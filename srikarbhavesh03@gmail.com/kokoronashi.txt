Hey, what if everything is thrown away
Does laughing make life easier?
My chest hurts again
don't say anything anymore
Hey, if everything is forgotten
Will it be easier to live without crying?
But I can't do that
don't show me anything anymore
no matter how close i get to you
i only have one heart
It's cruel, it's cruel, I'd rather take my body
Break it, tear it apart, do whatever you want
Even if I scream and struggle and my eyelids swell
You still hug me and won't let go
that's enough
Hey, if my wish could come true
i want the same thing as you
But I don't exist
Then at least come here
no matter how much i love you
i only have one heart
Stop it, stop it, don't be nice
I just can't understand
It hurts, it hurts, tell me in words
I don't know this, don't leave me alone
It's cruel, it's cruel, I'd rather take my body
Break it, tear it apart, do whatever you want
Even if I scream, scratch my eyes, and swell my eyelids
You still hug me and won't let go
that's enough
Hey, if I have a heart
how do i find it
you smile a little and say
it's right here
