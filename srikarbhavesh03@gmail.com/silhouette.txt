The go-line to step into the Isse Nose
we don't know anything yet
When I cross the line and look back, it's gone
we don't know anything yet
whisper whisper whisper
Sparkling sweat spills out
There must have been many things I didn't remember
silhouette
I pretended to forget what I cherished
There's nothing, it's funny
A boy who remembers at Isse no
we wanted everything
I know, oh, I know
The hands of the clock do not stop the days
take away take away
Flowing time and memory
far away far away
There must have been many things I didn't remember
silhouette
I pretended not to know what I was afraid of
There's nothing, it's funny
Dancing lightly and lightly
Like leaves, I want to spend my time without worrying and without worrying
There were many things I didn't remember
I'm sure there are things that will never change
You, who taught me, are an indelible, indelible silhouette
I'll become an adult with the things I want to cherish
Let's keep protecting without letting go at any time
then someday
I can laugh at everything
fluttering flutteringly
tree leaves fly
whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
