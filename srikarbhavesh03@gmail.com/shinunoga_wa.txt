Pinky swear, if I do tell a lie
I’m willing to swallow needles or anything on Monday
It doesn’t matter if it’s Sunday
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Who would give me the most everlasting love of them all?
No need to ask cause it’s my darling

I want you to be my last
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die
I’d rather die
I choose you over three meals a day
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die
I’d rather die

Still, sometimes my heart is being unfaithful
If it’s never cured, I’m sure to cure it baby
Yeah, I ain’t nothin but ya baby
“You don’t know what you got till it’s gone”
I’m sick and tired of repeating that same old cliché Goodbye
Oh, don’t you ever say bye-bye
Eh

I want you to be my last
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I choose you over three meals a day
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)

I want you to be my last
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I choose you over three meals a day
If I had to keep being separated from you like this
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)
I’d rather die (I’d rather die)

Still, sometimes my heart is being unfaithful
I don’t need that corny shit anymore bye-bye
I’ll always stick with ya, my baby
