Whoa
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnite
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine
And I know that we're close but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it low-key, I'll say it slowly
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
My love, know I'm in for the long ride (in for the long ride)
I'm not playing games of the wrong kind (of the wrong kind)
Could be keeping secrets and telling lies
But I'm just online, and I can promise you
I'll never play ya, I'll find a way to
Show you I'm grateful, so I'm begging you
Two minutes only, you'll get a trophy
I'm staying faithful
It's me and the PS5
Tell me why you making me decide (yeah)
Please, don't you see I'm live? (I'm live)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
Me and the PS5
Least you know where I'ma be at night (yeah)
Score's never been this high (so high)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
Me or the PS5
Me or the PS5
Me or the PS5
