Down south hood baby (hood baby)
Make all the girls go crazy (go crazy)
Go, go, go stupid
But you smart like an a plus student
Up down, right down
Looking for your love, right now
La, la, la, la
Up down, all around
Turn my stomach upside down
La, la, la, la
I found your hair tie in my car
I could only drive so far
Without a break down (ooh)
Baby, you're the queen of hearts
You know, how to play your cards
You keep 'em face down (ooh)
(Ooh), I miss your face now
Looking at your pictures
Scrolling, way down (ooh)
Wishing I could fix all my mistakes
I wish I could erase you
Girl, I can't replace you
You're the one that got away (ooh)
Girl, your energy
Feel so heavenly
Make me feel like
La, la, la, la
You a melody
Put to memory
It goes something like
La, la, la, la
Down south hood baby (hood baby)
Make all the girls go crazy (go crazy)
Go, go, go stupid
But you smart like an a plus student
Up down, right down
Looking for your love, right now
La, la, la, la
Up down, all around
Turn my stomach upside down
La, la, la, la
Girl, your energy
Feel so heavenly
Make me feel like
La, la, la, la
You a melody
Put to memory
It goes something like
La, la, la, la
