Every day, beneath the eyes, a dream walks by kohl burns the whole night, just as the lamp of the dream bums

Since the day my lips have tasted the sugar of your name
the pain has sweetened and so has solitude
My heart has a tiny problem, please resolve it have to learn to live while dying (every moment-implied meaning not literal), please teach me to die
you have let your hair loose on the eyes in such a way
that some poor, helpless dreams have lost their sleep
