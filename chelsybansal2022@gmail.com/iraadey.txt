My intentions!

How can I tell you, that there is no one, no one like you!

I stay close to you because my heart is desolate

You know all my feelings
No matter how much I watch you, my heart is never fulfilled by your sight

Look how beautiful the scene is that you and me are here together

Should I show you my intentions?

About you, by some excuse

Should I show you my intentions?


My, my intentions!
I would hum like this for you forever

And wish that your eyes always stays on a lookout for me only
How can I tell?
How can I tell the impact of you on my heart?

Look how beautiful the scene is that you and me are here together

Listen to my heartâ€™s cry

About you, by some excuse

Should I show you my intentions?

My!
My, my intentions!
