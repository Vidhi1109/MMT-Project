Not listening to words, not at all
Clouds hindered in the ensuing speed;
But no slowing down indeed
Destination one and only, paths are many.
Your mission is to continue your journey.
Unexpected twists and many a turn ordained when you were born.
Only the windshield will show what life will bless and bestow.
The wiper will wipe the tears which flow.
No listening to words, not at all.
Hair rising speed; full throttle.
No listening to words, not at all
Won’t slow down, full throttle.
Clouds hindered in the ensuing speed;
But no slowing down indeed .
Destination one and only, paths many
Your mission is to continue your journey.
Unexpected twists and many a turn ordained when you were born.
Only the windshield will show what life will bless and bestow.
The wiper will wipe the tears which flow.
Seeking endearing moments of cheer
If that’s what life is all about I hear
Whatever little is left over won’t you share it with me, dear?
Your mind will show you bonds that matter true.
Follow me like a shadow dutiful and teach me how to be helpful.
Many troubles may accost you. Your wallet will be empty too
Be it doom or gloom this car will zip zap zoom.
Your path may turn or bend even the city can change, friend.
Hard work pays till the very end.
The cloud tipped upside down on a withered heart all alone
It rained, what a downpour! Mind got drenched to the core
Won’t slow down, full throttle
Won’t stop, will put pedal to the metal
No listening to words, not at all
Hair rising speed; full throttle
Clouds hindered in the ensuing speed;
But no slowing down indeed.
Destination one and only, paths many.
Your mission is to continue your journey.
Unexpected twists and many a turn ordained when you were born.
Introduction into the next birth
Endless ecstasy on this earth.
Rainbow drizzle fell on the heart in a love-spell.
Only the windshield will show what life will bless and bestow.
The wiper will wipe the tears which flow.
