Why Don't You Stay? My Heart Is Yours Only

Why Don't You Hug Me To Your Heart?

My Feet Don't Want To Stay On The Ground At All

It Wants To Fly Like A Cloud Again And Again

If Beautifulness Turns Into A Woman, It Looks Like It'll Be Like You

I Don't Feel Shy To Ask For A Hug
When I See You. My Heart Rises Like A Wave
I'm Somewhere Wandering In An Unknown Place. I've Not Been Myself Lately
I've Never Seen A Silver Moon Along With The Burning Sun
Even In Darkness, I Was With You Like Your Shadow
Why Isn't There Another Birth For Me? Even This Minute With You Is Enough For Me
If Beautifulness Turns Into A Woman, It Looks Like It'll Be Like You
I Don't Feel Shy To Ask For A Hug
Why Don't You Stay? My Heart Is Yours Only
Why Don't You Hug Me To Your Heart?
