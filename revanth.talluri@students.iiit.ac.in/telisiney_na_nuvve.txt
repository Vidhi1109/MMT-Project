Came to know that you are not mine.
Came to know that I am not yours.
My past laughed seeing me as I am now.
This moment said so.
You are my life, you are my heart.
You settled as the fire in the heart.
The unexpected has happened, how now?
No more that you can say her now, what is this?
Mistake happened in a fraction of second.
It is haunting as a flood of sorrow.
I do not exist without you, said this moment.
You are my end and you are my challenge.
My challenge is worth this universe.
This universe.
Came to know that you are not mine.
Came to know that I am not yours.
