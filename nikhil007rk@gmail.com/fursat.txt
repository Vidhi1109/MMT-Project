"Be gentle when you pull on the curtains
Watch that your finger doesn't get stuck
Be a little careful when you lock the door
Whenever you're leaving the house"
 
I won't be able to tell you these things
Any longer now
Oh, how am I going to try and understand
The same thing myself?*
 
If you ever get time away from yourself,
Then please ask about me too
If you ever get time away from yourself...
 
In the palm of your longings/regrets
Hold a few memories of mine close too
In those moments you have to yourself,
Sometimes, please try saying this too:
 
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
 
Hmm... Oh...
 
Oh, I hope this story isn't a fleeting one
Hopefully I don't get lost, hopefully I don't lose you either**
They'll stay with me, these memories of ours
I tell myself a hundred stories of you, just you
 
If you ever get time away from yourself,
Then please ask about me too
If you ever get time away from yourself,
Sometimes, try saying this too:
 
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
 
(Heya, hey are you feeling okay?)
(Heya, hey are you feeling okay?)
 
There isn't any excuse remaining
Nor any reason
But there will come a morning
When I will meet you again
 
If you ever get time away from yourself,
Then please ask about me too
If you ever get time away from yourself...
 
In the palm of your longings/regrets
Hold a few memories of mine close too
In those moments you have to yourself,
Sometimes, please try saying this too:
 
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
Heya, hey are you feeling okay?
