my heart is not innocent at all
i don't know what happened to it
it is your fault it does not listen
i don't know what happened to it
 
my heart is going all around you
its crazy of you, and why can't i get enough of you
oh beautiful girl haaye oye haaye oye
i can't seem to figure it out
girl, haye oye haaye oye
i cant figure it out
 
my heart is going all around you
its crazy of you, and why can't i get enough of you
oh beautiful girl haaye oye haaye oye
i can't seem to figure it out
girl, haye oye haaye oye
i cant figure it out
 
my heart is not calming down, dear
your love is only doing all this
because of you my heart is now rebelious
your love is doing all this
 
my heart is going all around you
its crazy of you, and why can't i get enough of you
oh beautiful girl haaye oye haaye oye
i can't seem to figure it out
girl, haye oye haaye oye
i cant figure it out
 
i get swayed after you are mine
for your devotion there is no complaint
 
come close to me for a while sweet heart
i stop at your eyes, you are my life
just come close to me for a while sweetheart
you are my life
i have devoted my life for you
don't ever leave me
 
my heart is going all around you
its crazy of you, and why can't i get enough of you
oh beautiful girl haaye oye haaye oye
i can't seem to figure it out
girl, haye oye haaye oye
i cant figure it out
