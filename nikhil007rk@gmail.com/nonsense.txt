Look I am here for you
Open up your eyes and don't look away
I'm dripping down from the fangs
When I hear your name, I feel the pain
And I'm crawling on the floor just thinking that i'm a fool
But I wash myself and I'll stand again
After flying with angels, yeah
And now I'm backing out the corner
Don't you think that I'm a runner
I'll be coming with my guns up
Shooting at the moon to bring the sun up
Fall back and close your eyes
I'm at the bottom we can hide and be forgotten
Come closer, say my name
Say it forever, we can run away together
I keep on crushing on our love like this
On our love like this, on our love like this, yeah
I keep on crushing on our love like this
And we don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense
Well you said before
To let down and close my eyes when I am near
Grabbing at my chest with a broken heart, yeah
And I'm filled with fears
Well I've been ripped up and tossed like a mouse
Wrestled with the heavens and devil himself
Your voice can break my bones
And then you speak a force rushes in and slowly
Rips me to pieces, yeah
Well I would give my life to another
Just to prove I'm not a runner
I'll be coming with my guns up
Shooting at the moon to bring the sun up
Fall back and close your eyes
Come out the bottom we can hide and be forgotten
Come closer, say my name
Say it forever, we can run away together
I keep on crushing on a love like this
On a love like this, all your love like this, yeah
I keep on crushing on a love like this
And we don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense
Don't say anything at all
I don't wanna get pulled out
Just get close to me
I keep on crushing on a love like this
On a love like this, all your love like this, yeah
I keep on crushing on a love like this
And we don't need to say the words 'cause we're speaking nonsense
