I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
I know life will never be perfect
But the sunshine, it feels like I deserve it
You, yeah, you
Why you comin' over here with your cloud?
You, yeah, you
Why you always tryna bring my mood down?
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
So I'm here with a brighter perspective
So I really ain't tryna be stressin', ooh-woah
You, yeah, you
Why you comin' over here cold as ice?
Why? Why? Boo-hoo
A little optimism could be so nice
Maybe, if you wasn't being so shady
Throwing venom everywhere daily
You could chill, you could hang
But you ain't on that high
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like
So I don't (I don't) need you raining on my parade (parade)
Throwing shade (shade)
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, good vibes
I only want
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, good vibes
I only want
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, good vibes
(Good, good, good vibes)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, good vibes
I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Just good vibes, that's what I like (I like)
So I don't need you raining on my parade
Throwing shade (shade)
Be on your merry way
I only want good vibes (good vibes) 'round me tonight
No negativity in my life
Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
Oh, I only want good vibes 'round me tonight
