I was sitting in a corner when I saw her
She was the most beautiful and different from everyone else
Then my eyes connected with her eyes
Then I smiled for a couple of times
One hand of mine was in the air and the other one had a glass
I didn't even know what was in my glass
But she was dancing slowly shaking her waist
She was looking so sexy
She was looking at me and I was looking at her
The tension in the air was growing
I swear on god, I've never drunk alcohol
But still I was feeling a little intoxicated
I wasn't able to stop myself
I went to her
And I said I wanna talk
She said, go ahead
I went closer to her and I asked
Baby do you freak like you dance
Cause you dance like a pro
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Don't move like you're moving now
You'll definitely send me to god
Your body is hotter than the fur of a chinchilla
What did your mother feed you while you were growing up
My heart comes to a stop when you get down low
Please have some mercy on me
Don't take my life in this manner
Don't take my life in this manner
I searched a lot, but I couldn't find anything bad in you
The ground slipped from underneath my feet
Now please stop teasing me
I'm joining my hands and I'm saying please
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
Have some mercy on me
It's your boy Badshah
