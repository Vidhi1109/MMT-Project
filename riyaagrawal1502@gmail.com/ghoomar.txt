Hold your gaze at the courtyard
The queen is arriving
We welcome you to do the folk dance with us
Come let's do the folk dance
We welcome you to do the folk dance with us
Your beloved is feeling angry from within
Today my heart is very scared and restless
My heart is in love with my beloved and it desires for him
The anklets are jingling as the women are dancing
The bells in the anklets are chiming
Come let's do the folk dance
Come let's do the folk dance
I'll do the folk dance covering my head with the rainbow of love
Yes, I'll do the folk dance
I'll do the folk dance forgetting all the customs of the world
I'll dance on the beats of the drummer
The women are doing the folk dance
My entire body wants to become the shadow of my beloved
Whenever my heart dances it turns loneliness into a fair
I'll dance on the beats of the drummer
The women are doing the folk dance
My beloved has come
The light of your feelings is like Diwali for me
I've coloured all the walls of my heart's palace with your colour
The light of your feelings is like Diwali for me
I've coloured all the walls of my heart's palace with your colour
After attaining your shade my entire body is shining
This dark night of mine has become full of stars
I'll dance on the beats of the drummer
The women are doing the folk dance
I'll do the folk dance covering my head with the rainbow of love
I'll do the folk dance forgetting all the customs of the world
I'll dance on the beats of the drummer
The women are doing the folk dance
Come and do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance together
Wear the skirt, top, veil and anklets
Let's do the folk dance
The younger and older sister-in-law's are dancing
The mother-in-law is dancing
The maternal and paternal sister-in-law's are dancing
The women are dancing
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
Let's do the folk dance
