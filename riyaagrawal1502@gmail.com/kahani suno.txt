Please, listen to my story. Listen to it in my native tongue.

I’d found myself in love. and I had admitted it.

I had discovered love. I had acknowledged it.

I was passionately in love; I was ecstatically in love.

It was a wonderful story about your love.

They all bother me, the fragrance when you came and the times you went.

I haven’t seen you in a long time; I need to meet you.

Please pay attention to my voice and the tyranny of the beloved that I am conveying.

I’d found myself in love. and I had admitted it.

My desire is to make you my bride.

I’d get your name henna-drawn on my hand.

I’d take all of your issues. I would turn away an ill eye from you.

It is my wish to have you for the rest of my life.

Look here, being faithful in love is not tough.


My entire universe is in your eyes.


Please attempt to comprehend what I have never been able to articulate.


You are my entire universe and my sole source of support.


Please pay attention to my prayers. Listen to my anguish as I express it.


I’d found myself in love. and I had admitted it.


Please, listen to my story. Listen to it in my native tongue.


I’d found myself in love. and I had admitted it.


I had discovered love. I had acknowledged it.
