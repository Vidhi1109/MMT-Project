O girl, the prince of your dreams
Is coming
A garland, a procession and a palanquin
He's shining with all that
The auspicious moment has come
Hey ya ... hey ya
Hey ya, I've come wearing a headdress
Hey ya, I've brought palanquin and a procession
Hey ya, I've come wearing a headdress
Hey ya, I've brought palanquin and a procession
Now I can't wait even for a day
O beauty, either today or tomorrow
You're going to be mine
I'll take you with me
I'll give my heart to you
I'll take you with me
I'll give my heart to you
Hey ya ... hey ya
Hey ya ... hey ya
Come and tell the world
That you're the story of my love
Hey ya ... hey ya
O beloved, say this making any excuse
I'm you're body and you're my soul
Don't hide anything
You find such love with great difficulty
A beautiful girl like you
I don't want to lose anyone like that
I'll take you with me
I'll give my heart to you
I'll take you with me
I'll give my heart to you
Don't torment me soo much
Look at me with that lovely gaze
Hey ya ... hey ya
O beloved, take your voice
And let it be heard with mine
Please say yes
You've made me restless
O partner, I've said this to the world
That I've become yours
I'll come with you
I'll go to my in-laws place
I'll take you with me
I'll give my heart to you
Hey ya ... hey ya
Hey ya ... hey ya
