Why didn't I believe you
Why did I stay separated from you
Life kept on tormenting me
Only you gave me shelter
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
What is this suffering and punishment
Why am I remembering you today
My days are restless
My nights are restless
Tell me what should I do
My legs themselves
Are my shackles
Please free me from myself
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
What is the person within me saying
Come let me pay back your debts
My eyes are wet
My breaths are pricking me
My wound is fresh again
In the loneliness of the heart
In my story
You have always been there
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
Our relationship is very old
O o o ... aa aa aa ... very old
O our ... aa aa aa ... very old
