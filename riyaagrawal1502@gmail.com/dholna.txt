Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
I rather die than revealing this secret
O beloved ... O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
You were a couple of steps from me
I was a couple of steps from you
You were a couple of steps from me
I was a couple of steps from you
But these couple of steps
Weren't less than a hundred miles
On top of that this heart was jumping
O beloved ... O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
Look, you've won over me
I've lost against this heart
Look, you've won over me
I've lost against this heart
Today on these lips
This love has finally come
This love will make us go crazy
Go crazy ... O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
I rather die than revealing this secret
O beloved ... O beloved
Until when should we stay quiet
Now I want to say something
You say something
I'll say something, O beloved
