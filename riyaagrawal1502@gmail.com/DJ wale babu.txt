I'll create your government in the club
I'll turn your table into a bar
I'm Badshah, but tonight I'll make you a star
I'll do a lot of great work
I'll buy this dance floor for you
If someone stares at you then I'll give them a tight slap
Dance as much as you want baby in the shower of champagne
The minister in power is a fan of this friend of yours
Hey DJ, please play my song request

I keep the world under my shoes
I'll even become a DJ if you want
I'll play songs for you day and night
Hindi songs, English songs, new songs, and even old songs
Give me an order, no need to request
Keep dancing baby and don't rest
I'm a patient of your body
So please don't test my patience
Hey DJ, play the song what this girl is asking for
I'll take care of any other shortcoming that remains
Hey DJ, please play my song request
It'll be great fun if you play my song
It'll be great fun if you play my song
Hey DJ, please play my song request

Come baby, I'll play your song
Come baby, I'll play your song
I'll play your song
I'll play your song, come baby
I'll play your song, come baby
I'll play your song
