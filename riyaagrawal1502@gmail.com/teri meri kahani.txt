you keep travelling within me,
keep passing with every breath..

all the time, you are mine,
nothing is mine without you..
we are two bodies and one life,
never be separated from me..
your and my story,
is like the water of rains,
which rains like love,
your and my story

see, how we have got permission (from Divinity)
we have got safety, security in each other

We have got fulfilled all the needs that are there for life,
This drink that it is, it should remain
just the way it is, forever, forever

whatever this thing that has happened through us,
itâ€™s love, love that has happened

we are so much (complete) together 
that there is nothing that is lacking,
however much I have to live,
I have to live (with) you only,
whatever way we live

all the time, you are mine,
nothing is mine without you..
we are two bodies and one life,
never be separated from me..
your and my story,
is like the water of rains,
which rains like love,
your and my story..
