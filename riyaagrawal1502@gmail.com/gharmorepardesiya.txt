There's a custom in the Raghu clan since ages
Even if you lose your life, you must never break your promise
All hail Lord Rama, the king of Ayodhya and the scion of the Raghu clan
All hail Lord Rama
All hail Lord Rama, the king of Ayodhya and the scion of the Raghu clan
All hail Lord Rama
O scion of Raghu clan, Sita is gazing at your path
O scion of Raghu clan, Sita is gazing at your path
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
After losing my senses and wisdom
After losing my senses and wisdom, I've attained a precious jewel called Lord Rama
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
Neither lullaby of my mother, nor the Holi festival of spring
I've lost interest in everything
Since my eyes have connected with an archer
Since then this separation is troubling me
Neither lullaby of my mother, nor the Holi festival of spring
I've lost interest in everything
Since my eyes have connected with an archer
Since then this separation is troubling me
The entire world knows about my dilemma
The entire world knows about my dilemma, except this cruel one
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
This crazy one went to the river bank to fetch water
I went to the river bank to fetch water
This crazy one went to the river bank to fetch water
I went to the river bank to fetch water
This lovely deer has become wounded by the arrows of your eyes
I'll dance to my heart's content
I've become your devotee
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
O foreigner, I welcome you into my home
