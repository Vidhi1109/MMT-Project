Even you agree or don’t, It’s graciousness
That you are spending love life with me,
How angry I be
You evince that much love of yours
My princess, May rest of my life span be added to you.

Sometimes in anger I speak recklessly to you
But still don’t live a single second without you
Even a moment comes to kill when I am alone
My princess, May my rest of  life span be added to you.

Live long, my every mistake forgetter
I am afraid of losing you
When you kiss my forehead
It reliefs me
My princess, May my rest of life span be added to you.

f there was somebody else
She would have left ‘Fateh’
Until now, would have forgot him from the heart
’Chhanna Wala’ cannot show his attitude in front of you
My princess, May my rest of life span be added to you.
