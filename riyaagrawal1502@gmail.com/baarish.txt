I still remember your smile
And it automatically makes my eyes smile as well
I still remember your smile
And it automatically makes my eyes smile as well
Sometimes I do forget about you
But the raindrops destroy every attempt of mine
The rain remembers you a lot
The rain remembers you a lot
Even today it talks to me about you
The rain remembers you a lot
The rain remembers you a lot
Even today it talks to me about you
The rain remembers you a lot
The very first time when I saw your face
I placed you through my eyes into my heart
The very first time when I saw your face
I placed you through my eyes into my heart
I haven't forgotten about your shelter
In which I spent a lot of time
You embraced me right before we got separated
My helpless eyes are still praying for you
The rain remembers you a lot
The rain remembers you a lot
Even today it talks to me about you
The rain remembers you a lot
