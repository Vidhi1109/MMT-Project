One day we both were alone
We both were lost in each other
That day whatever you said secretly in my ears
Don't say that to anyone else
You're mine and always remain mine
You're mine and always remain mine
Always support me and be by my side
You're mine and always remain mine
There's a place in both these worlds
What I feel is very safe
When it comes to your arms
They're the world for me
Keep me locked in your arms
You're mine and always remain mine
You're mine and always remain mine
The pain in my heart would've been immense had you not been there
I would've died if I wouldn't have fallen in love with you
You're there within me more than me
Today make this promise to me
That you'll never say goodbye to me
You're mine and always remain mine
You're mine and always remain mine
Always support me and be by my side
You're mine and always remain mine
