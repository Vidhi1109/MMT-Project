Come around
It's time to baby come around
Come on now come around
It's time to baby come around
Come around, come around
Without dreams
My eyes were living
No one was there
My life was very lonely
Oh oh yeah!
I was quiet
I had no words on my lips
No one was there
My life was very lonely
When I found you, I found the world
When I found you, moments were new
When I found you, I became far from all
When I found you, there was magic
When I found you, I learned to live
When I found you, I found God
Come around
It's time to baby come around
Come on now come around
It's time to baby come around
Come around, come around
With my eyes closed
My love was sleeping
There was fragrance in the air
But I didn't feel it
Oh oh!
I don't know where
My spring was blossoming
There was fragrance in the air
But I didn't feel it
When I found you, rain smelled good
When I found you, desires awakened
When I found you, all looks colourful
When I found you, there was magic
When I found you, I learned to live
When I found you, I found God
You heard my prayers
You answered my heart's call
What else can I ask from you
I'm incomplete without you
I'm complete with you
I thank you for that
How should I say ... how should I say
Oh yeah yeah yaah!
How should I say
These moments are touching me
It feels as if
Your emotion is there in them
Oh oh!
How should I say
There are new footsteps in the heart
It feels as if
Your emotion is there in them
When I found you, I lost my heart
When I found you, I found everything
When I found you, others are nothing
When I found you, there was magic
When I found you, I learned to live
When I found you, I found God
Come around
It's time to baby come around
Come on now come around
It's time to baby come around
Come around, come around
