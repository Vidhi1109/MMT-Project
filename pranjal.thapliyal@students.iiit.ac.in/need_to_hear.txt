I get out my records
When you go away
When people are talking
I miss what they say
'Cause it all means nothing, my dear
If I can't be holding you near
So tell me you love me
'Cause that's all that I need to hear
I sit in my kitchen (George, do the hi-hats now)
With nothing to eat
With so many friends I
I don't want to meet
'Cause I don't need music in my ears
I don't need the crowds and the cheers
Oh, just tell me you love me
'Cause that's all that I need to hear
I've been told so many times before
But hearing it from you means much more
So much more
Reply to my message
And pick up my calls
You see, I wrote you a letter
It was no use at all
Oh, I don't care if you're insincere
Just tell me what I want to hear
You know where to find me
The place where we lived all these years, oh
And tell me you love me
That's all that I need to hear
Oh, tell me you love me
That's all that I need to hear
