Considering me looking through you
Thinking it was something I used to do
Thought I'd done anger, I thought I'd done shame
But I've always been the same
Oh, don't you know that I'm a human too?
You know that you're a human too?
And darling, that's what humans do
So tell me you're a human
I'm sorry 'bout the bomb thing, that's overdue
I'm sorry that I quite liked seein' myself on the news
And I'm, I'm sorry that I'm someone that I wish I could change
But I've always been the same
Yeah, I've always been the same
And don't you know that I'm a human too?
You know that you're a human too?
Darling, that's what humans do
So tell me you're a human
And don't you know that I'm a human too?
You know that you're a human too?
Darling, that's what humans do
So tell me you're a human
And don't you know that I'm a human too?
Should know that you're a human too
Oh, darling, that's what humans do
So tell me you're a human
Oh, tell me you're a human
Tell me you're a human
