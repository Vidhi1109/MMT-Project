until I fill you completely with love
until I read you a hundred times like prayers,

stay close to me,
don't talk about leaving.
stay with me,
don't talk about leaving.

you have come in my arms,
taking a hundred mornings.

you have been brought down from the clouds,
for me, just for me.

until my fingers say something
to your hair.
until my wishes flow a bit
in your waves.

stay close to me,
don't talk about leaving.
stay with me,
don't talk about leaving.
