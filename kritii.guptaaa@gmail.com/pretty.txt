Whoa, yeah
Hey, oh
Yeah, ayy
Boy, you look like a cock-a-doodle-doo
Whoa, whoa
Yeah, whoa
Yeah, here's the track, yeah
Y'all thought we left? We'll never leave
New York City to Atlanta, baby
Alright
Yeah, I'm sitting pretty but I'll leave you scarred
'Bout to pop some bottles on the fuckin' boulevard
I don't need your car, yeah, my Uber's large
Lip gloss shining, you see it from afar
Just like Michael Jackson, I'm a smooth criminal
Just like Michael Jackson, I'm a moon-walking hoe
I'm hanging with the cutest crew
You know how I do, Clair-Clair too
We be pulling through
In the nicest silks with the strongest drinks
You know what I mean, it's the sweetest thing
Honestly, just look at you then look at me
I'm feelin' pretty, no matter the city, we're packin' knives
And we out here ending lives (ring, ding-ding, all day, baby)
If I die tonight, I'ma make it look pretty
Yeah, I'm in your spot, yeah, I'm in your city
Actin' real rude, bad attitude
Actin' real goofy but if I cuss you out, I'ma make it look pretty
If I start a fight, I'ma make it look pretty
Yeah, I'm in your spot, yeah, I'm in your city
Actin' real rude, bad attitude
Actin' real goofy, but if I get kicked out
I'ma make it look pretty
Get up out my face, you look like a reptile
Need Bindi Irwin in case it's about to get wild
Don't follow me when you're looking like Vincent Gallo
Keep a taser in my purse, no that shit's not hollow
If I beat you up, I'ma make it look pretty
Nails still intact and yeah I'm still witty
If we in this thing, it's about to get litty
You can have the spotlight in a little bitty (ring, ding-ding)
If I die tonight, I'ma make it look pretty
Yeah, I'm in your spot, yeah, I'm in your city
Actin' real rude, bad attitude
Actin' real goofy, but if I cuss you out, I'ma make it look pretty
If I start a fight, I'ma make it look pretty
Yeah, I'm in your spot, yeah, I'm in your city
Actin' real rude, bad attitude
Actin' real goofy, but if I kick it out, I'ma make it look pretty
Make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it
Make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it
Make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it
Make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it
Make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it pretty, make it
