Did you stand there all alone?
Oh, I cannot explain what's goin' down
I can see you standin' next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face
Do-do-do
Do-do-do
You can drive all night
Lookin' for the answers in the pourin' rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall, you were lookin' out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees
Do-do-do
Do-do-do
You can drive all night
Lookin' for the answers in the pourin' rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Lookin' for the answers
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standin' in the pourin' rain
Do-do, do, do, do
Do-do, do, do-do, do-do
Do-do, do, do, do
Do-do, do, do-do, do-do
You can drive all night
Lookin' for the answers in the pourin' rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
If we can find a reason, a reason to change
Lookin' for the answer
If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standin' in the pourin' rain
