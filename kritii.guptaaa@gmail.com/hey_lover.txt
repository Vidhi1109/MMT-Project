Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey)
You don't have to be a star
Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey)
I love you just the way you are
For love is just the same
Without fortune or fame
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey)
You don't have to be a queen
Hey, hey, hey, lover (hey-hey)
You don't have to have a thing
For I'll be satisfied
Long as you are my bride
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
For the rest of my days
No, you shouldn't have to worry
Love's no problem in my hands
Just know I really, really, love you
And in your heart, I'd be a big man
Hey, lover, won't you treat me right
And be with me tonight?
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
For the rest of my days
No, you shouldn't have to worry, girl
Love's no problem in my hands
Just know I really, really, love you
And in your heart, I'd be a big man
Hey, lover, won't you treat me right?
And be with me tonight
Just give me
True love and understanding
True love and understanding
