Sunflower
Sunflower
My eyes, want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers
Sometimes
Keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
Wondering headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste
Before I got to know you
I've got your face
Hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade
(Sunflower, sunflower)
Your flowers just died
Plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower (Sunflower, sunflower)
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight)
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dance hall
I couldn't want you any more tonight
Sunflower
My eyes, want you more than a melody
Let me inside
Wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died
Keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo, woo-woo, woo
Woo-woo, woo, woo-woo, woo
Woo-woo, woo, woo-woo, woo
Yeah
Ooh-woo, ooh-ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
