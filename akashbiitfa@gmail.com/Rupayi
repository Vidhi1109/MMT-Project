These hands move like the night's breeze,
Like a paper boat.
She pulls me from my pocket to hers, pulling and pulling.
Roopaay roo roopaay
This is Roopaay, heeeey Roopaay.
Roopi roopi roopi roopaay
Roopi roopi roopi roopaay
Fingers and toes are entwined
Four pairs of eyes meet
Sweets are exchanged
One Roopaay can save a life.
For this drama, there are two colors:
Black or white.
She takes away my cash in hand.
Wrong is right.
If her debt is not paid,
Then, even God won't help.
Roopaay roo roopaay
This is Roopaay, heeeey Roopaay.
Roopi roopi roopi roopaay
Roopi roopi roopi roopaay
We'll scatter like dust,
Fight for victory,
And spin the wheel of life from birth to death.
Roopaaay.
