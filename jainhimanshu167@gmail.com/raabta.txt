They say that for everyone in this world, God has
made someone or the other, for each one
You meeting me is a sign believe me
I am made for someone like you
Some contact is there with you
Some relation is there with you
How should I know, what do I know
Some contact is there with you
You are my partner so why should I worry
This is the reason to live and will die for this
It obliged me while going
A passing moment fulfilled my wishes
I got a view of yours, got sparkling starts
Destinyâ€™s boats got a shore..
A life for which I've craved for centuries,
In your company all the prayers are for that (life)
You meeting me is a sign
as if I am made for someone like you
