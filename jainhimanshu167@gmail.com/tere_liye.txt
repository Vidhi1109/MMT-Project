I have lived for you,
with my lips sealed.
I have live for you,
drinking every tear drop.
but there were the lamps of love
burning in my heart.
for you, for you.
Life has brought me the book of old, past days,
now I'm surrounded by uncountable memories.
I got so many answers without even asking.
Look, what we had wished, and what we got.
Yet, there were lamps of love burning in the heart,
for you, for you.
What do I tell you, what ill will the world had against me.
The order was that I should live, but without you.
Those are naive, who say that you are not my own.
We were tortured so much by the people,
but there were lamps of love burning in the heart,
for you, for you.
