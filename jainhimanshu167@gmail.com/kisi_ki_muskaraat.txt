Offer yourself to bring a smile to someone
Share a shoulder to bear someone's pain
Have love for someone in your heart
This is the name of life
Offer yourself to bring a smile to someone
Share a shoulder to bear someone's pain
Have love for someone in your heart
This is the name of life
I agree that I'm poor when it comes to money
But still my friends, my heart is rich
I agree that I'm poor when it comes to money
But still my friends, my heart is rich
Life is great when it's sacrificed for love
Life is great when it's sacrificed for joy
I have faith in this even if no one else has
This is the name of life
Trust bridges the hearts
The name of love exists due to me
Trust bridges the hearts
The name of love exists due to me
Someone will remember me even after I die
I'll smile in someone's tears
Flowers will say this to the buds all the time
This is the name of life
Offer yourself to bring a smile to someone
Share a shoulder to bear someone's pain
Have love for someone in your heart
This is the name of life
