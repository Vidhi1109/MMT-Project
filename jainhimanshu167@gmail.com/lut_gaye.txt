When I saw you for the first time
I still remember that night
I slept counting the stars
And my heart was beating fast
You said something with a smile
And that moment itself I became yours
The god who resides in the skies
I just pray to him that
I want to see the moon everyday along with you
As the eyes opened love started to pandiculate
An exchange of hearts happened in a moonlit night
Your eyes did some magic on me
As I was devastated in the first meeting itself
As the eyes opened
Don't put your feet on the ground
Beloved, please wait for some time
Let me lay some stars for you
Test me out beloved if you want to
If you give me just a signal
Then I'll light my heart and brighten up your path
A person as crazy as me in love
You'll never find someone
Don't think and just give your hand in my hand
As the eyes opened love started to pandiculate
An exchange of hearts happened in a moonlit night
Your eyes did some magic on me
As I was devastated in the first meeting itself
As the eyes opened
The stories of love that are there in the books
I want to act them all with you
Now how important you are for me
It's hard to say that in words
Now the situation is such that
If you ask for my life
Then I'll happily give it to you as a gift
As the eyes opened love started to pandiculate
An exchange of hearts happened in a moonlit night
Your eyes did some magic on me
As I was devastated in the first meeting itself
As the eyes opened
