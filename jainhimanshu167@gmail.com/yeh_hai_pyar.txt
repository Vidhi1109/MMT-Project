This is love, this is love
You can't trust it as you can fall in love with anyone, anytime
This is love, this is love
You can't trust it as one doesn't know who they'll fall for
This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love
It's an unique thing and not something common
Not everyone can fulfill it
Not everyone can become a lover
When two hearts collide
Then the hearts turn into birds
They open their wings to fly
You can't trust it as you don't know when will the birds fly
This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love
We both were strangers for each other
I have no clue how
We've now become crazy for each other
In crying and sighing for you
In being in love with you
In sacrificing myself for you
I might lose my life, you just can't trust it
This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love
You can't trust it as you can fall in love with anyone, anytime
This is love, this is love
This is love, this is love
You can't trust it as one doesn't know who they'll fall for
