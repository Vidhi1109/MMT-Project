The beginning is shattering
Say the hordes of heads (collection of people)
Today is the time of war, give a shout!
Pride, show, prestige
Or life itself to be sacrificed
Give (it all up) to an arrow from the bow
If the mind wishes (he) give his life
If the mind wishes takes a life
That is the man who is most powerful
This is the call Krishan gave
This is the essence of the Bhagvat (Gita?)
That war is the proof of valor
Be it a horde of Kauravs
Or the strength (?) of the Pandavas
He who can fight is the only one who is all powerful
No greed for winning
No control over anyone
What is this life â€“ kick it away
Death is not the end
Then why be afraid to die
Go shout this out to the skies!
Is it the feeling of pity
Or the choice of valor

Or is it the wound of failure, ponder on it
Be lit with the red of victory
Should your brown face

Be lit with the red of victory

This red vermillion, ponder on it

The color is saffron, or the drum is saffron

Or is the beat saffron, ponder on it!

The poet whose imagination

Thinks life is a song of love

Today deny that poet

In your drenched veins

In your pounding blood

Throw in a sizzle of the flames of fire
