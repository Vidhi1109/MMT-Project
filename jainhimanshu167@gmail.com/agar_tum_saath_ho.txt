Wait for a moment
Let this heart settle down
How should I stop you
Coming towards me
May every grief slip
Let me fill you in my eyes
Let me talk to you without words
If you're with me
If you're with me
I'm flowing
Like a river in your world
My world lies in your desires
I get dissolved in your habits
If you're with me
Your dreams are in your eyes
There is dissatisfaction in your dreams
I feel like the talks of the heart
Are deceitfulness of the words
Whether you're with me or not
There was no difference
Life was unsympathetic
Life is unsympathetic
If you're with me
If you're with me
In the blink of an eye
The day passes by
I'm running around while sitting
Coming towards me
May every grief slip
Let me fill you in my eyes
Let me talk to you without words
If you're with me
If you're with me
Your dreams are in your eyes
There is dissatisfaction in your dreams
I feel like the talks of the heart
Are deceitfulness of the words
Whether you're with me or not
There was no difference
Life was unsympathetic
Life is unsympathetic
If you're with me
Let this heart settle down
If you're with me
May every grief slip
If you're with me
The day passes by
If you're with me
May every grief slip
