Your face is like a piece of moon,
Your goggles, your shoes,
What to say about that (they are amazing.)


Your kohl is very striking,
It fascinates me,
What to say about it? What to say about it?


From your waist you seem like from .Karachi city,
You’re a fan of buggati car,
I feel like wanna be with you only,
Your body scent is like cardamom’s fragrance.

 

Your eyes, sharp nose, and even more attractive face cut,
What to say about that?


You’re looking so hot, girl,
Seeing you makes me think nasty.


 

You’re cheeks are pink with charming dimples,
Which takes boys’ breath away,
The one who sees you once is not able to sleep properly for atleast 3-4 months.

 
Your walk, red-apple cheeks,
And the whole you, what to say about it, it’s priceless.

 

Hug me dear or I shall die in this cold winters.

 
The pink lips are so alluring,
And the sandals make sounds like choo-choo,
What to say about it all, it’s so incredible.
