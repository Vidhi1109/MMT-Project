We will never break our friendship
Till my last breath
I will not leave your side
We will never break our friendship
Till my last breath
I will not leave your side
Your victory is my victory
Your defeat is mine
Listen carefully my friend
Your sorrow is my sorrow
My life is yours
Such is our love
I will risk my life
I will take one for you
I will risk my life
I will take one for you
Enmity with everyone
We will never break our friendship
Till my last breath
I will not leave your side
People see us as two people
But look, we are not two
To drift apart or to quarrel
Lord we pray that does not happen
We will eat and drink together
We will live and die together
We will eat and drink together
We will live and die together
All our lives, forever
We will never break our friendship
Till my last breath
I will not leave your side
We will never break our friendship
Till my last breath
I will not leave your side
