If you want to fall in love
I know what love is.


I ask only,
My heart for permission,


The ways of love
Only the fortunate know.


Risking my own life
I saved the enemy.


Many people love to talk
many people.


I know what’s real, my friends,
My friends…


Many people love to talk
I know what’s real, my friends,


I can even stop the wind
The Lord showers you with prayers.


When Pathaan gets into the groove,
my love…He steals all hearts.


The promises he makes,’
My love…He’ll stand by forever.


When Pathaan gets into the groove,
my love…He steals all hearts.


The promises he makes,’
My love…He’ll stand by forever.


I’ll tell you how to win hearts,
my friends.


I will tell you how
I will tell you how.


I’ll tell you how to love the enemy.


I will tell you how
I will tell you how.


Just give me a sign
A sign
I’ll give my heart to you twice over.


Just give me a sign
A sign
I’ll give my heart to you twice over.


The feeling of friendship has cast their spell,
Even enemies turn to me for an embrace.


When Pathaan gets into the groove,
my love…He steals all hearts.


The promises he makes,’
My love…He’ll stand by forever.

Jhoome Jo Pathaan Meri Jaan
When Pathaan gets into the groove,
my love…He steals all hearts.


The promises he makes,’
My love…He’ll stand by forever.
