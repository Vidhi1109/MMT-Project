God knows
God knows
How much my heart loves you


God knows
God knows
How much my heart loves you


I can not live without you
I fell ill with love
I ask you with my prayers


God knows
God knows
How much my heart loves you


How does this love happen?
How does this color bloom?
Look at this happening with your eyes


What is the moon?
How does this lamp light?
Look this inside your eyes


I don’t know when the day passed
I don’t know anything
I ask you with all my prayers


God knows
God knows
How much my heart loves you


See the world through my eyes
I did not watch my eyelids
I didn’t make the deal of a lifetime
I will promise you the promises of the seven lives


God knows
God knows
How much my heart loves you
