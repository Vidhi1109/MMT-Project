O daughter of the moon
O daughter of the moon
O daughter of the moon and sister of the clouds
Everyone calls you lightning
Everything gets destroyed wherever you strike
Even the stars are scared of you
O Cinderella
O Cinderella, I've come for you
My heart is wearing anklets and dancing
When you wear the dark kohl in your eyes
Then the entire city of Ludhiana runs behind you
Then the entire city of Ludhiana runs behind you
They're staring at your sharp eyes
O daughter of the moon and sister of the clouds
Everyone calls you lightning
Everything gets destroyed wherever you strike
Even the stars are scared of you
O Cinderella
This young man is attracted to you
You feel like cool breeze in the heat
I'm your chocolate and you're my sugar
I'm on top of the world
Even you're on top of the world
Your sharp eyes are intoxicating everyone
You're as light as three flowers
I'll wait for you even if you're late
You're eyes look like a green lake
You're a green lake and people click pictures with you
O daughter of the moon and sister of the clouds
Everyone calls you lightning
Everything gets destroyed wherever you strike
Even the stars are scared of you
O Cinderella, I've come for you
My heart is wearing anklets and dancing
When you wear the dark kohl in your eyes
Then the entire city of Ludhiana runs behind you
You're amazing, you're a commotion
You're red like an apple from Kashmir
You walk amongst angels like a dream
What more do you want when this lover is with you
Some write about your hair
Some write about your lips
Everyone who writes about you describes you as flowers
The great poets like this lover want to sit besides you
O daughter of the moon and sister of the clouds
Everyone calls you lightning
Everything gets destroyed wherever you strike
Even the stars are scared of you
O Cinderella, I've come for you
My heart is wearing anklets and dancing
When you wear the dark kohl in your eyes
Then the entire city of Ludhiana runs behind you
O daughter of the moon
O daughter of the moon
