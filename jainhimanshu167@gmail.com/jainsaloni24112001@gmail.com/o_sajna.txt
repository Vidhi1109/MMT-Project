O Love, after falling in love with you
I forget the goodness of the world
Love teases, Love makes me weep
After coming in love, I was destroyed
The light of your eyes
The fault of my heart
You made me a hermit, O Love
How I should make you understand?
After your love got over me
You taught me how to love, O Love
O My Love, O Love
You made me a hermit, O Love
O My Love, O Love
You made me a hermit, O Love

I won't be able to bear distances from you
My eye filled tears, My eye filled with tears
Even in loneliness, there is loneliness
My eye filled with tears when I remembered you
Why does it make me feel uncomfortable?
Why does it make me weep?
Why even after wishing for you
I can't get you?
Why these distances are (between us)?
Why did tears come rolling down?
Why can't I
cut short all the distances?
When the prayers of the heart come to the lips
They call you, O Love
How should I make you understand?
Why I should forget you?
I only want you, O Love
O My Love, O Love
You made me a hermit, O Love
OO My Love, O Love
You made me a hermit, O Love
