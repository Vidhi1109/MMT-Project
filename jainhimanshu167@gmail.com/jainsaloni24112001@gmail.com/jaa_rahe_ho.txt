Where are you going all by yourself
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Someone is dying, do you have a clue
Someone is dying, do you have a clue
Someone has become yours, do you have a clue
Someone has become yours, do you have a clue
What's the matter, do you have a clue
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Don't leave me yearning, you're my life
Don't leave me yearning, you're my life
Don't look away, you're my life
Don't look away, you're my life
Don't break my heart, you're my life
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
What will you do if someone stops you
What will you do if someone stops you
What will you do if someone holds your feet
What will you do if someone holds your feet
What will you do if someone flatters you
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Take me with you wherever you're going
Where are you going all by yourself
Where are you going all by yourself
