I will drink the wine you gave me.
How will I go home I will fall here


I am a bud if you touch me
I will bloom in to flower
I will be yours,
I will find you.


When you move,
When you grove,
My world stops.


Your youth is Killer. (4)
(Leave me)


I can not walk
Or can I control.


Where else would I go if not In your arms?


If you canâ€™t save
I can not save myself.


If you touch me
I will burn in to ashes.


O my dear, you are fire and I am water.
Where do you go my lover
Come and hug me


Your youth is Killer.(4)

Leave me

Your youth is Killer.
