Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
You're in my breathes
My life is your shadow
You're in my breathes
My life is your shadow
I'll worship you always
These are your good deeds
Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
You're in my breathes
My life is your shadow
I'll worship you always
These are your good deeds
Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
(Sargam)
Morning and evening in your feet
I'll burn oil lamps
Wherever I see
I find only you
Oh ... morning and evening in your feet
I'll burn oil lamps
Wherever I see
I find only you
On my lips only your name will be there
On my lips only your name will be there
The love in my heart shall never reduce
These are your good deeds
Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
This is not a house
But your temple
In this forever
You may reside
Oh ... this is not a house
But your temple
In this forever
You may reside
May it smell good with your fragrance
May it smell good with your fragrance
No matter what season comes and goes
These are your good deeds
Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
You're in my breathes
My life is your shadow
You're in my breathes
My life is your shadow
I'll worship you always
These are your good deeds
Happiness at times, sadness at times
We shall not separate
Happiness at times, sadness at times
