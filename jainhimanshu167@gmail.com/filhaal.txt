Tell me one thing, do your memories torment you
Do you still love me
Tell me one thing, do your memories torment you
Do you still love me
Tell me about the person whom you love now
Does he know how to comfort you
Tell me about the person whom you love now
Does he know how to comfort you
This lover of yours has filled oceans with tears
Did you also fill rivers with your tears
Tell me one thing, do your memories torment you
Do you still love me
Please give an answer to this question of mine
As I've been asking this question to myself time after time
As I've been asking this question to myself time after time
Should I love the person who loves me
Or should I be committed to the person I love
Or should I be committed to the person I love
The only difference between our love is that
I was scared of you and you're scared of him
Tell me one thing, do your memories torment you
Do you still love me
My companion keeps asking me questions about you
As I've called her many a times by your name
As I've called her many a times by your name
If I couldn't be yours then I won't belong to anyone else
This is my promise, do you promise the same
Tell me one thing, do your memories torment you
Do you still love me
Don't remember me so much that I have to break someone's heart
And that I have to leave the one whom I'm with now
Don't remember me so much that I have to break someone's heart
And that I have to leave the one whom I'm with now
Say whatever you have to without any fear
Do you love me more or him
As I've already left, at least give an answer now
