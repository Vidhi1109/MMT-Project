Such love you bestow upon me….


The way you come close to me…

 


Such love you bestow upon me….



The way you come close to me…



I keep on falling for this sweet heart stealing tricks of yours



I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….



 



Your fondness is such,



I spent entire night awake



How affectionate your fondness is o beloved…

 



You did whatever you pleased with my heart,


You didn’t listen to me at all,



Why did you torment me such way o beloved…

 



How do I say this to you?



That I cannot live without you



How do I explain this to you



That I simply can’t live without you…



This distance between us would kill me…

 


I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….



I have become all yours….
