Tie me up with fragile threads
There are no distances in between strong friendships
All this anger of yours is fake
My beloved, listen to the talks of my heart
We'll talk about the heart sitting together and looking into each other's eyes
We'll do it everyday and fulfill our true love
Why do you trouble me
Why do you pretend in front of me
Of falsely being upset with me
We'll talk about the heart sitting together and looking into each other's eyes
I've adorned you in my eyes and hid you from everyone as you're my faith
Make me yours
Beloved, I'm only there for you
May distances never come in between us
I've adorned you in my eyes and hid you from everyone as you're my faith
Make me yours
Beloved, I'm only there for you
May distances never come in between us
I'm your life
I'm your life
You're my life
Tell me what will you prove with your tantrums
We'll talk about the heart sitting together and looking into each other's eyes
The nights are dark and my beloved is fair
My companion, come and embrace me
My skies don't listen to the weather
And it doesn't weave any complete dreams
We'll talk about the heart sitting together and looking into each other's eyes
I know why you look at me secretly
Adding your name to mine
We'll talk about the heart sitting together and looking into each other's eyes
