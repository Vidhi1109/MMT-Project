Oh! Beloved Smiling in my eyes
Oh! Beloved Smiling in my eyes
Oh! Beloved residing in my heart
My life is yours
Before I die I wish to give you my life
 
I looked at you and my eyes fell in love with you
My eyes were so mesmerized they forgot the whole world
 
I looked at you and my eyes fell in love with you
My eyes were so mesmerized they forgot the whole world
 
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
 
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
 
In your arms I lost myself
The fragrance of your breaths became a part of me
 
I forgot the whole world and let love take me away
I forgot the whole world and let love take me away
 
I feel like touching the sky
I feel like drowning in your love
 
What good is my living
What good is my living
 
If you are not by my side
We will live together and we will die together
We can't live without each other
 
We will live together and we will die together
We can't live without each other
 
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
 
As is the condition of fish without water
Such difficult has been my living without you
 
Long has been my wait, come and take me away with you
Long has been my wait, come and take me away with you
 
Loneliness has dispersed me straw by straw
These long separations from you have taken my life away
 
Day and night I am restless
Day and night I am restless
 
Oh! I have turned crazy
Even my pulse has started to stop
The last ray of hope seems to be leaving me too
 
Even my pulse has started to stop
The last ray of hope seems to be leaving me too
 
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
Even God must have fallen in love
