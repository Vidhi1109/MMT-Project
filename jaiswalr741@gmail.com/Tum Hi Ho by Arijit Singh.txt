I can't live without you now
What is my worth without you?
I can't live without you now
What is my worth without you?
If I ever got separated from you
Then I'll get separated from myself

Because you're the one
Now you're the one
You are my life
My peace and my pain
You alone are my love

What kind of relationship exists between us?
Not for a moment can I stay away from you
I live every day only for you
I dedicated all of my time to you
I don't wish to live a moment without you
And wish to have your name on my breath

Because you're the one
Now you're the one
You are my life
My peace and my pain
You alone are my love

I only live for you
Now that I have I devoted myself to you
Your faithfulness keeps me in the right path
I let go of all the sadness from my heart
With you, my destiny got fulfilled
After I achieved you
I was no longer incomplete

Because you're the one
Now you're the one
You are my life
My peace and my pain
You alone are my love
Because you're the one
Now you're the one
You are my life
My peace and my pain
You alone are my love
