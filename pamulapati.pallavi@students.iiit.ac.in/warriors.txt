As a child, you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
Here we are, don't turn away now (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town (don't turn away)
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
