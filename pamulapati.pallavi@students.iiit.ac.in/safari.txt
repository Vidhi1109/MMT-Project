Im sure Ive seen you in my dreams

Im feeling like aint first time we ever meet

You make the time fly slow slow

Just like slow rivers flow slow


I see the fire in your eyes

It makes me feel it takes me high

So bring it on the dancefloor


Baby you better start this right

Im losing it I cant control this

Must be love love


Come on boy move that body

Cuz tonight Im naughty naughty

Dance with me like its my party

We go wild were in safari


Come on boy move that body

Cuz tonight Im naughty naughty

Dance with me like its my party

We go wild were in safari


You better keep your eyes on me

I know youre not

The only one whos watching me

When all the night stars glow glow

We dance among them slow slow


I see the fire in your eyes

It makes me feel it takes me high

So bring it on the dancefloor


Baby you better start this right

Im losing it I cant control this

Must be love love


Come on boy move that body

Cuz tonight Im naughty naughty

Dance with me like its my party

We go wild were in safari

Come on body move that body

Cuz tonight Im naughty naughty

Dance with me like its my party

We go wild were in safari


Come on boy move that body

Cuz tonight Im naughty naughty

Dance with me like its my party

We go wild were in safari


Come on boy move that body

Come on boy move that body

We go wild were in safari


We go wild were in safari
