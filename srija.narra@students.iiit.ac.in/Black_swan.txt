Do your thang, do your thang with me now
Do your thang, do your thang with me now
What's my thang? What's my thang? Tell me now
Tell me now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayy, they say their heart isn't beating
When I listen to music anymore, tryna pull up
Time seems to stop
Oh, that would be my first death, I've been always afraid of
If this doesn't make me cry anymore
If you can't make my heart tremble more
How can I die like this once?
But what if that moment's right now, right now?
In my ears, only the sound of a slow heart bump, bump, bump
Even if you want to escape, into that mouth jump jump jump jump
No song can reach me, so I scream silently
The sea where all lights are silent, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch my lost ankle again, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't hear any sound, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now, do you hear me? Yeah
Sinking slowly as if possessed, nah, nah, nah
Even if I struggle, the floor is everywhere, nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now, do you hear me? Yeah
Do your thang, do your thang with me now
Do your thang, do your thang with me now
What's my thang? What's my thang? Tell me now
Tell me now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Deeper, yeah, I think I'm goin' deeper
I keep losing my focus, I hate letting go now
I'd rather go on my feet, I'll jump in
In the deepest depths I saw myself
Slowly I open my eyes This is my studio, my studio
Even if strong waves pass me by in the dark
I will never be dragged away again and again
Inside, I saw myself, myself
Only the sound of a fast heart in my ears, bump, bump, bump
Open your eyes and go to my forest, jump jump jump jump
Nothing can swallow me, I scream with all my might
The sea where all lights are silent, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch my lost ankle again, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't hear any sound, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now, do you hear me? Yeah
Sinking slowly as if possessed, nah, nah, nah
Even if I struggle, the floor is everywhere, nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now, do you hear me? Yeah
Do your thang, do your thang with me now
Do your thang, do your thang with me now
What's my thang? What's my thang? Tell me now
Tell me now, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
