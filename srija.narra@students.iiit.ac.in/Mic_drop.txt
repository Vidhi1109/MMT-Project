I don't care If you have a mic, you'll win this game
Moro, you're like a half-cooked steak anyway
Stop the star ey here
world business core
sold out every day
Unrivaled class value enjoyment
you're a mess
Mic, mic bungee
Mic, mic bungee
Bright light before
I'm about to lose, but I'm fine, sorry
I'm sorry Billboard
sorry worldwide
sorry mom for being too popular
instead your filial piety
I'll do it at my concert, hurry up
I do it, I do it, you're bad ratatouille
If you break your stomach Come on man, sue it
Did you see my bag?
Did you see my bag?
Bag full of trophies
How you think 'bout that?
How you think 'bout that?
Haters hide
This success that shines in gold
I'm so firin', firin' now in flames
You get impatient and run away
How you dare?
How you dare?
How you dare?
I can't count the trophies in my hand
It's too heavy, I can't bear it
MIC Drop
MIC Drop
Precaution
Note that mic mic
La-di-da-di I need a break
I'm too busy
MIC Drop
MIC Drop
Rhyme, rhyme
Note that mic mic
Look, there's "rust that came out of my body"
once upon a time
Aesop's Fables Fly
Look at that now
If I'm fine, I'm super satisfied
where to fly next
How long is your flight?
Yeah, I'm on the mountain
Yeah, I'm on the bay
burnt down on stage
MIC Drop, bam
Did you see my bag?
Did you see my bag?
Bag full of trophies
How you think 'bout that?

Haters hide
This success that shines in gold

Live a life man
Good luck
I won't see you again, this is the last time
I have no words, nothing to hear
I won't see you again, this is the last time
I have no words, nothing to hear
Gradually everyone regrets
Knowing gaps for us
Just admiration and astonishment
Everybody stand up Everybody stand up yeah
