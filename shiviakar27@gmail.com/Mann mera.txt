All night long it sighs
It dies in your memories all the time
This heart of mine doesn't listen to me
There's some consciousness and intoxication
There's some drowsiness and unconsciousness
My heart doesn't know a thing
It was mine earlier, but now it's a stranger
This crazy heart of mine doesn't understand
Sometimes it remains quiet, sometimes it sings
It praises you without even asking
Are you some truth or a story
All it knows is that, it's mad for you
This heart of mine doesn't listen to me
She's in every vein of mine
She's all over my heart
She's in me just like my life
She's like falling water of the rain
She's like a story
Which is being told from heart to heart
This heart of mine is your old lover
This crazy heart of mine doesn't understand
Sometimes it remains quiet, sometimes it sings
It praises you without even asking
Are you some truth or a story
All it knows is that, it's mad for you
This heart of mine doesn't listen to me
It pulls me and looks at you
It simply runs behind you
It's passionate for you, you're my peace
With you only the threads of my heart are tied
Sometimes it remains quiet, sometimes it sings
It praises you without even asking
Are you some truth or a story
All it knows is that, it's mad for you
This heart of mine doesn't listen to me
