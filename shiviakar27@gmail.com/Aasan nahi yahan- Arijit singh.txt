It's not easy to be a lover here..
To adorn thorns on eyelids..
A lover get gifts of sorrows,
Not everyone gets this treasure..


Ahead of talks, ahead of promises,
see sometimes..
It's a fireball,
it's a spark,
it's wild fire as well..

You run behind bodies,
some time get down into the soul..
What is a lover,
what love is..
You'll get to know.
