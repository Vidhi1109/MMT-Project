Whenever I came near you
I found peace
The one whom I kept forgetting
I found that existence
When the weather of sorrow came
I remembered you
When I was scared in loneliness
I remembered you
O heart, be steady
You're going to fall in love once again
O heart, stop here itself
You're going to fall in love once again
How did this happen
I have no clue about that
O heart, be steady
You're going to fall in love once again
O heart, stop here itself
You're going to fall in love once again
The street on which your house is there
I've often passed through that street
Probably this was there in my heart
That may be I'll attain you, who knows
What is this story
I have no clue about that
O heart, be steady
You're going to fall in love once again
O heart, stop here itself
You're going to fall in love once again
When there's nothing between us
Then why does the heart weave your dreams
I tried to forget you
But even that was not possible
What's this matter
I have no clue about that
O heart, be steady
You're going to fall in love once again
O heart, stop here itself
You're going to fall in love once again
O heart, be steady
You're going to fall in love once again
