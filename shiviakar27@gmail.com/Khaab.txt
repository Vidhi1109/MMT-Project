When I Walked To Ways of Your Dreams,
I Walked Long And Couldn’t Get Back,
Like Papers Stay Together With Papers,
I Wanna Stay With You Like That,

I Used To Write About You,
Go And  Ask Stars, They Are Witness,
Those Who Mock Let Them Laugh,
Those Who Taunt, Let Them Taunt.

My Heart Always Misses You,
Don’t Fall For Anyone, But For You,
Be My Queen, I’ll be Your King,
You Be My Home, I’ll be the Door.

Seeing You, I Get Floated Towards You,
You Are Flower And I’m Attached With You Like a Stem.

When I Walked To Ways Of Your Dreams,
I Walked Long And Couldn’t Get Back,
Like Papers Stay Stick With Papers,
I Wanna Stay With You Like That.

Dont’ Give Too Many Excuses to Me, Dear,
Moreover, Couldn’t Stay Bachelors,
I Got So Many Dreams, Let Me Tell,
Don’t Send Me Away, Let Me Stay Close,
Wish This Love Be Prosperous, Don’t Let it Be Less,
For the Ages I Want To Stay Stick With You,
Like Papers Stay Stick With Papers,
I Wanna Stay With You Like That.

Let’s Make A World Together,
If Gets Sulked, We’ll be Normal Instantly,
Will Fill Your Bag With Happiness,
Will Give You a Dream House.

These Words Are Not Fake, I’ll Make It True,
I Pray To God, For You,

When I Walked To Ways Of Your Dreams,
I Walked Long And Couldn’t Get Back,
Like Papers Stay Stick With Papers,
I Wanna Stay With You Like That.
