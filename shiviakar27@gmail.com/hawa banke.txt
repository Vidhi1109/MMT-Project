I am the ground and you are my sky.

I am a scar (or blemish) while you are beautiful like the moon.

You are the most awaited rain and I’m like sand.

I am a melody while you are a song.

I am the ground and you are beautiful like sky.

I am a scar (or blemish) while you are the moon.

You are the most awaited rain and I’m like the sands.

I am a melody while you are a song.


Make me yours, O sweetheart.

Make me yours, O sweetheart.

I want to live being yours.


The doors, the windows…

Passing through all the doors, windows & walls;

You come over, as the winds does, dear.


The doors and the windows…

The doors and the windows…



I wanna touch you;

As one is desperate to touch the moon.

I wish to have you;

Like a child wishes for a toy.

I wanna touch you;

As one is desperate to touch the moon.

I wish to have you;

Like a child wishes for a toy.


In the night of anxiety;

You are the sleep of comfort & peace.

In the season of autumn;

You are the first drop of rains.

Nirmaan (The Songwriter) has paid the ‘Feast of the Sacrifice’ today.

The doors, the windows…


Like the winds, I will come through passing all the doors, windows & the walls.


The doors, the windows.
The doors, the windows.
