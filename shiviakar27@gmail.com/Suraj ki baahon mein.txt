In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
The heart changed it's walk ... ah aa
I just thought of this ... ah aa
We only get one chance to live
Then why shouldn't we love it openly
Who knows for whom are we waiting
As this is life, this is life
Till yesterday what was a wish ... ah aa
We both have achieved that ... ah aa
Let's hold our hands together like this
Let's roam around the city together
All day and all night long
There is happiness pouring everywhere
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
The one who can weave new dreams
Call that life as life
The one who can choose new paths
Call that life as life
The one who is always dancing
And walks swayingly is life
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
We only get one chance to live
Then why shouldn't we love it openly
Who knows for whom are we waiting
As this is life, this is life
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the arms of the sun
This life is there now
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the sun ...
Now it's ...
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
In the sun ...
Now it's ...
There are sunrays in our breaths
And light in our conversations
