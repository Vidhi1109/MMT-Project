Don't say anything if you don't want to
Even be silent, if you want to be
I know your love
The silent face and your patrol on my eyes
are the witnesses of your love on their own

Your leaned eyes, your every style
are telling me this story
There is someone who now a days
has spread over your mind and heart
Your leaned eyes, your every style
are telling me this story

Whenever your swirls fall
Oh beautiful, you started looking more beautiful
The fairy about which we kept on studying in books till today
is seen in you by us


I want to live always
in your arms only and in your shelters
I want to live always
in your memories and in your eyes
I want to live always
in your arms only and in your shelters
Always..
