You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles
You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles

Your bangle is giving me a signal
Your bangle is giving me a signal

i have fallen in love with you
you come and see with me
want to take you downtown
I want to make you go round and round with the feeling of love

oh listen to me
i can’t feel without you
don’t you look at me like that
you look like a killer to me

You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles
You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles

your eyes drive me crazy
tell me what to do
i can’t sleep at night
without you

my love you come to me
don’t go away again
hi i love you
If you love then follow it

You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles
You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles

Your bangle is giving me a signal
Your bangle is giving me a signal

I want to make you mine my love
Now you have to marry and bring home
since i saw you
my heart has gone crazy

 You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles
You wash your feet and put on your ankle bracelets, 
your nose ring sparkles

Your bangle is giving me a signal
Your bangle is giving me a signal
