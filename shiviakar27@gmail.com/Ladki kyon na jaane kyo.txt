I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
They think a lot
They understand less
They think a lot
They understand less
Their heart says something
And they do something else
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
They think a lot
They understand less
Their heart says something
And they do something else
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
Even she loves you but
She wants you to confess
She is confused with herself
But she tries to untangle her hair
(I mean you're all the same
We are good friends
But I haven't seen you from that angle
All that is alright
But I haven't thought about it)
She will tell you that you're unique
And she will come close to you
After a few days itself
She won't find anything unique in you
(Oh my, what shirt are you wearing
How do you make your hair
You drive so fast
Why do you eat in a hurry
Give me a break!)
She comes closer to change you
She puts a trap to erase you
With her conversations
She will trap you
First she will make you laugh
Then she will make you cry a lot
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
I don't know why, but girls
Are not like boys
Hey, if you're happy with yourself
Then why do you come behind me
Sometimes flowers and 1000's of gifts
Why do you bring them
(You didn't tell me your name
You want to go out for a coffee
Should I drop you home
When will you meet me next)
Scattered and meaningless
Is your broken life
And you say that you're different
Openly and being bold
(The wet towel stays on the floor
The cap of the toothpaste is somewhere
You wear old socks by reversing them
You have no clue about time)
She teaches you manners
She makes you human from an animal
Even a moment with her
You won't survive
She knows that
You won't be able to say that
That's why girls
Are not like boys
That's why girls
Are not like boys
Who knows what all dates
She will make you remember
She may forget love
But she won't forget dates
(On 1st March our eyes connected
On 4th April I came to meet you
On 21st May you touched me
On 6th June I felt something)
Who knows about boys
They may turn around at any turn
Now they belong to one
And suddenly they'll fall for anyone else
(Your mother and father are not in the house
Great ... can I come over
Your friend is going home alone
Poor her ... should I drop her ... oh my!)
To say one yes she makes you dance
We get tired but she's having fun
She is shy
That's why she's hiding it
When a girl say yes
Then she stands by it
That's why girls
Are not like boys
That's why girls
Are not like boys
Na na na ... why girls
That's why girls
Are not like boys
(Oh come on shut up!)
That's why girls
Are not like boys
(Alright alright
What's there in this to fight
Initially like bees
They wander around you
Then they say that they are busy
And they will push you away
Try to understand darling
Today I have a lot of work
So what if I'm far
Your name is there in my heart
The face that they die for
That becomes boring to them
In a few days their eyes
Start looking around
Only love is not enough to run life
Why don't you do a course of interior decoration
Ok that's it!)
