From my body to soul 
You are imprinted everywhere
You have become my life


Since you met me,
My life and heart has become happy
My every happiness exists because of you


You are my love
My peace is due to you
I have inhabited you in my memories


Intoxication is because of you
Light headedness is because of you
I have decorated you in my dreams




Until I hadn't met you,
There was neither happiness nor grief
When I met you,
This seasons of my life changed


The Lord who is answering my prayers,is in you
Everything lacked something,but I got everything in you


Seeing you day and night, is a habit of mine
Loving you like this,is worship for me



My eyes were desert, you are a cloud full of rain
You are in my desires, I am crazy for you



You are a flowing river,while I am a drowning shore
I am sacrificed for you, you are all that I have


Since you are in my arms,My beloved,
There is a light in The shelter of my heart
