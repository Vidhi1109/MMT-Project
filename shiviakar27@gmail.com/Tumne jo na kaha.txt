I kept on hearing all that you never said
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
I kept on hearing all that you never said
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
I don't know whose evil gaze has caught me
There is no place for me in this city anymore
I kept on walking away from my desires
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
There is more pain now than before
I once again made a promise to myself
May the silent eyes stay speechless
Now the conversations are not like before
My lips tremble when I talk
I can't express the secret in my heart
Now there is no effect over me
I'm on a journey but I don't have a companion
I kept on going far, I kept on coming near
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
Once again she came in front of me
And the talks between us started happening
The smoke from the past is pricking my eyes
Your condition is not like mine
Why am I sad in this happiness
Why is the same world settling again
The world from which I had come far away
Is coming once again into my view
The past moments are hurting my heart
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
I kept on hearing all that you never said
I kept on weaving dreams without any reasons
I don't know whose evil gaze has caught me
There is no place for me in this city anymore
I kept on walking away from my desires
The fire was out but the stain still kept burning
