listen a little while, my heart speaks
to you, heartbeat by hearbeat,
this love
is the springtime
if there is love
every little garden will bloom

listen, this is what this excitement is saying
we'll walk together
taking all the colors of love

desires are up now
feelings are young
there is a new wave in the heart..

i am there, heart is there and you are there
only this talk is there
you are mine, are mine..

desires get out of control
dreams melt
we change
slowly slowly

weather is nice
so will leave the conciousness
have to get mad
slowly slowly


don't know what is this magic
is this atmosphere everywhere..
when eyes met your's
moonlight is out in day time

When you are there so this weather is there
else what is this world
this beauty you only got..
