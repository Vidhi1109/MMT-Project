A moment or two
Why is life so short
For this love
Even ages are not enough
So I'll ask god
For some more time
Now I only want to live here
I don't want to go far from you
If you're there to share my pain
If you're there to share my pain
Every pain is pleasant
If you're there to share my pain
Your smiles are my strength
I've got hope through them
No matter what injustice this world does
My safe haven is in them
Life became very beautiful
Now where else can heaven be
If you're there to share my pain
If you're there to share my pain
Every pain is pleasant
If you're there to share my pain
Your heartbeats are my life
Your wishes now are my prayers
What a unique bond this is
As our souls unite to be one
Yes I'll come back here to you
This is my promise even if I die
If you're there to share my pain
If you're there to share my pain
Every pain is pleasant
If you're there to share my pain
Hmmm ... share my pain
Hmmm ... share my pain
Hmmm ... share my pain
Hmmm ... share my pain
