I may never be able to say this to you
So please understand without me saying it
May be one day in my memories
You'll come and meet me somewhere
I won't be able to live without you
I won't be able to live without you
I don't want anything more than you, neither less than you
I'm not myself without you
I'm not myself without you
I don't want anything more than you, neither less than you
Give my eyes dreams by asking a question
And you yourself give the answer from your side
I do useless things and if I have to go somewhere
Then I always pass from your side
These attempts won't reduce
These attempts won't reduce
I don't want anything more than you, neither less than you
I won't be able to live without you
I'm not myself without you
I don't want anything more than you, neither less than you
Without you
