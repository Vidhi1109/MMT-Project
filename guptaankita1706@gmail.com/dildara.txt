When the night has come
When the night has come
Then the land is dark
When the night has come
When the night has come
Then the land is dark
And the moon is the only light
And the moon is the only light
And the moon is the only light
We will see darling darling

O rehbara mere rehbara
Oo tujhse vasta
Tu manzil hai aur tuhi
Uss manzil ke aagey ka rasta

O rehnuma o mere rehnuma
Oo tere naam sa
Ab koi bhi labhz nahin
Padh kar dekhein
Sau kitaabein sau dafaa

Dildara dildara
Yeh ratti bhar ka jag sara
Dildara dildara
Tere nazaro kadam
Pe sab vaara
Oo dildara dildara (2x)
Tab jeeta jab tujhse haara
Dildara dildara
Darling darling stand by me
Come on and stand
Stand by me just as
Long as you stay
Stand by me darling darling
Stand by me stand by me
Just as long as you stay
Stand by me

When the night has come
Then the land is dark
And the moon is the only light
When the night has come
Then the land is dark
Darling Darling

O mehrama mere mehrama
O poori hai dua
Ab kuch bhi toh aandh nahin
Tujhe paa ke lagey
Mukammal hai khuda

Dildara dildara
Yeh ratti bhar ka jag sara
Dildara dildara
Tere nazaro kadam
Pe sab vaara
Oo dildara dildara (2x)
Tab jeeta jab tujhse haara
Dildara dildara
Darling darling stand by me
Wonâ€™t you stand
Stand by me just as
Long as you stay
Stand by me darling darling
Stand by me stand by me
Just as long as you stay
Stand by me
