I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I'll be alright
With you even the crooked paths
And the twisted conversations
Seem straight to me
With you even the false promises
And the intentions of the enemy
Seem true to me
The one who makes my heart active
You're that one, you're that one
The one who brings a smile when I cry
You're that one
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
The whole world is on one side
And we are on the other side
Every happiness is running away
Only sorrows are coming my way
But when you smile for me
The world seems all right
My life
Blooms in a moment
I don't know why
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
Yeh yeh yeh
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I'll be alright
Yeh yeh yeh
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
Yeh yeh yeh
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I'll be alright
Yeh yeh yeh
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
The one who makes my heart active
You're that one, you're that one
A few small moments
Make up our friendship
I don't know why do I feel as if
I'm familiar now
Coz when smile for me
The world seems alright
May all these moments
Stop right here
I don't know why
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
With you even the crooked paths
And the twisted conversations
Seem straight to me
With you even the false promises
And the intentions of the enemy
Seem true to me
The one who makes my heart active
You're that one, you're that one
The one who brings a smile when I cry
You're that one
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
I don't know why my heart knows that
If you're there then I'll be alright
I'll be alright, I'll be alright
