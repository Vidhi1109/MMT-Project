my craziness won't kill me,
my vagrancy won't kill me.
more than death,
your anger will kill me.

why are you so upset with me?
what are you so stubborn about?
more than death,
your anger will kill me.

I am ready to give my life,
for your love, O my beloved.

I have ended my relationships
with so many,
my friendship is with you only,
come once at least.

I have lived up to it,
I have done it,
now it's your chance.
for once, you too live up to this love.

the age of my wait
is longer than that of your apathy.
more than death,
your anger will kill me.
