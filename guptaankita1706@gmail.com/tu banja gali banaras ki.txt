You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening
Hmmm... You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening

Your words are like spicy chaat
Your eyes are like the banks of the Ganges
I'll fall asleep on the riverbank
And wake up in you every morning

You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening

My moon, pass by my window
So I can adorn you on my forehead
I'll tie you up in my tresses
And make you my ribbon

My moon, pass by my window
So I can adorn you on my forehead
I'll tie you up in my tresses
And make you my ribbon

I'll keep you like this, never lost
You'll never belong to anyone else
If I find you, I'll get lost
Then I'll search for myself in you

You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening

One day, take me away from home
And I'll travel with you
You're the wind, I'm the storm cloud
You tease me and make me flow like water

One day, take me away from home
And I'll travel with you
You're the wind, I'm the storm cloud
You tease me and make me flow like water

You in my happiness, you in my sorrow
You in every season of my love
You sit in my shadow
And I emerge like sunshine in you

You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening

You become the streets of Banaras
And I wander in you until evening
