Time stopped in a single moment
When you gave your hand in my hand
I'll go wherever you want to go
I'll be on your right and you'll be on my left
I'm the season and you're the winds
I smile when you sing
I cry when you're upset
I'll get drenched in your rain
Your face is my shadow
Such is my condition these days
I'm the morning and you're the sunlight
I'm the mirror and you're the image
Your companionship is just amazing
You've given me all the colours of love
Then you took me with you
Let's get lost somewhere
Where time can come to a stop
And tomorrow won't come along
I'll give you hundreds of dreams if you ask for one
If you're happy then I feel blessed
You're different from everyone else
You're just like me
I can't differentiate between you and me
Time stopped in a single moment
When you gave your hand in my hand
I'll go wherever you want to go
I'll be on your right and you'll be on my left
I'm the season and you're the winds
I smile when you sing
I cry when you're upset
I'll get drenched in your rain
