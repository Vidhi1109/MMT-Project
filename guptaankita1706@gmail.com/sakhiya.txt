O..aa...
 
Girls taunt me
Dear, stories are circulating
Where and with whom you use to be in evening
Have seen photos of the car
 
I feel scared
That poor heart will break
 
You have many friends
But you are my only friend
You have many friends
But you are my only friend
 
Na na…
 
When i sit alone
Thoughts bother me
You go outside to pickup the phone
Who calls you
 
Please don't do this to anyone
Today with someone and tomorrow with someone else
You are the only one i can live with
I don't have solution with anyone else
 
If you stop me for doing something
I won't do that again
You have many friends
But you are my only friend
You have many friends
But you are my only friend
 
Don't think that why don't i stop you
That's fine, just don't stop you to meet your friends
(x2)
 
Sometime, take me to watch movie
Sometime, take me out also
If i am offended once in an year
At least, make up
 
At one side there is you
Other side the whole world
 
You have many friends
But you are my only friend
(x4)
 
Na na…
