Why nowadays there's less sleep and more dreams
It seems like there's some good intention of God
Yesterday I was a beggar, today my heart is a prince
It seems like there's some good intention of God

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

In my world, on these rocky paths
There's a blanket of flowers
Since we met, every sight has changed
Look where I am, under the blue sky
Colors are new, as if they're melting
My dreams, soaked in yours, wake up for you
My path is wet with your thoughts

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Why do you keep coming
In my dreams every day?
Come quietly into my arms one day
Your dreams, in darkness and light
There's some kind of intoxication in your eyes
In my dreams, in answers and questions
I steal you every day in my thoughts

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
