You are like no one else to me
No one can compare
I brought a big heart with me
But it doesn't seem to fit anywhere

I haven't found your color
My dear friend and star
Without you, I am completely colorless

My heart doesn't settle down
For you every moment
I pray for your well-being

When you made me drink from your eyes
You brought a drunken color
I became crazy in your love
My beloved, I became a wanderer

Taking your strings in hand
My heart is lost in promises
Today I am flying like a kite
My beloved, as if soaring in the sky

When you made me drink from your eyes
You brought a drunken color
I became crazy in your love
My beloved, I became a wanderer

Love seems to be breaking free
From behind the veil
It will be revealed to everyone
There is no one else but us
Our love is written on every page

No matter how many times you hide it
Love cannot be kept hidden if it's intoxicated
Love seems to be breaking free
From behind the veil
It will be revealed to everyone

When you made me drink from your eyes
You brought a drunken color
I became crazy in your love
My beloved, I became a wanderer

Taking your strings in hand
My heart is lost in promises
Today I am flying like a kite
My beloved, as if soaring in the sky

When you made me drink from your eyes
You brought a drunken color
I became crazy in your love
My beloved, I became a wanderer

Taking your strings in hand
My heart is lost in promises
Today I am flying like a kite
My beloved, as if soaring in the sky

In your love, my beloved,
I became a wanderer.
