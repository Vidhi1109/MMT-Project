Away I go, carrying passion with me
Drinking droplets of time
My heart has flown from its cage
I'm falling in love with myself
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
Away I go, carrying passion with me
My heart has flown from its cage
I'm falling in love with myself
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
For Akira, pop it up
Move aside, hey get up
Everybody wanna be her
Hey she's Akira!
Small moments in time
If you catch them like a butterfly
Then the colour stays in your hands
When you leave it by its feathers
Time keeps moving
But time still leaves its colour, Akira
However a flying moment
I got hold of it
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
Hey hey hey ... for Akira!
In light curtains
I like to smile
If it gives light then
I like to set the hearts on fire
Even if it's for a moment
Keep Akira with you for life
However a promise to life
I've made one
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
Away I go, carrying passion with me
My heart has flown from its cage
I'm falling in love with myself
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
I'm embracing life with open arms
