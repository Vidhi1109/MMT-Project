We had just met. And we are separated now.
What was my fault? That you turned suffering (or punishment) for me.
After losing me forever, You would miss me someday.
And then you would pray to see me.
Our meetings were incomplete.
I promise that I will complete them.
I would talk about you to desolation too.
The moment you are not part of,
May I never have such memories.
“The pray I hadn’t asked you in,
May I never have such prayers,” by God.
After losing me, someday you would miss me.
And then you would probably beg (or pray) to catch a glimpse of me.
