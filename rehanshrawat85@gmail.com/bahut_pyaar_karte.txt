Sweetheart, I love you a lot
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
If you want, take a promise from me
If you want, take a promise from me
In the name of God
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
My poem is your imagination
My poem is your imagination
Now I can't accept living without you
I'll keep loving you like this
I'll keep loving you like this
Until I'm breathing
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
The fun that is there in the arms of the ocean
The fun that is there in the arms of the ocean
I love you to the same extent
This restlessness
This restlessness
Will not reduce now
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
If you want, take a promise from me
If you want, take a promise from me
In the name of God
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
Sweetheart, I love you a lot
