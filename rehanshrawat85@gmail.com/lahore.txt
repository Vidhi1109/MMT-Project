Your eyes are doing some black magic over me
The entire London shakes when you move your waist
You'll kill the guys
You'll kill the guys, so don't smile girl
Girl tell me where's your village or your city
She looks from
She looks from Lahore based on her smile
She looks from Punjab based on her stare
She looks from Lahore based on her smile
Find out this girl's village or city
She looks from Lahore based on her smile
She looks from Punjab based on her stare
She's got tantrums of a Delhi girl
Her style is very unique
She'll make the guys go mad
She'll make the guys go mad based on her walking style
She looks from Lahore based on her smile
Find out everything about this girl
Find out everything about this girl
I want to save myself from these killer styles
But I'm unable to do that, what should I do
I always keep asking for her heart
And I'm unable to forget her, what should I do
I've got tantrums of a Delhi girl
My style is very unique
I'm not impressed by your words my dear
You can try as much as you want, but I'm not going to fall for you
I'm out of your league
I'm out of your league, trust me my dear
If there's anything else to say, then say it my dear
She fires bullets from her eyes
She fires bullets from her eyes, but yet she loves me from within
She looks from Lahore based on her smile
She looks from Punjab based on her stare
Find out everything about this girl
Find out everything about this girl
