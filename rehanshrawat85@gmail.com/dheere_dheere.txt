I think of myself every time
You are in my thoughts
If I talk about heart (love)
Then who should I talk with
 
Your and my, my and your same or one life
Same life what to do
I should dance, I should sing
Or I should write to you, what to do
 
Come to my life gradually
Steal my heart gradually
How much I love you my beloved
I need to tell you after meeting
 
The same evening, the same work
Without o beloved
There is no sleep, there is no relax
Without you oh beloved
 
Your and my, my and your same or one life
Same life what to do
I should dance, I should sing
Or I should write to you, what to do
 
Come to my life gradually
Steal my heart gradually
How much I love you my beloved
I need to tell you after meeting
 
Your, my story is like
Bing Bag Theory
I listen silently all of this
You are far away from me, I am helpless here
I will complaint to God that...
 
Spending one day without you seems to be one year
My condition became worse
My condition became worse
Tell me ever about your condition
Come to me ever back
 
I sleep, sometimes I weep
Without you o beloved
I lose everything after getting
Without you oh beloved
 
Your and my, my and your same or one life
Same life what to do
I should dance, I should sing
Or I should write to you, what to do
 
Come to my life gradually
Steal my heart gradually
How much I love you my beloved
I need to tell you after meeting
