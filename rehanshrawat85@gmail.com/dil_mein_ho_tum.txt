I kept looking as my heart followed you
There's something between us that has been unsaid
What I've never said I'm saying it for the first time
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
It's due to the conspiracy of love that we've met again
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
Since the first time I saw you
I'm a crazy traveller and my legs don't stop anywhere
My waywardness has started to dream about you
I'm a crazy traveller and my legs don't stop anywhere
My waywardness has started to dream about you
No one wants freedom from the jail of love
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
It's due to the conspiracy of love that we've met again
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
Since the first time I saw you
All these seasons were colourless and dull without you
All the moments that you were not a part of were useless
The life that I'm living is nothing without you
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
It's due to the conspiracy of love that we've met again
You're there in my heart and my eyes since the first time I saw you
Since the first time I saw you
