She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
The girl collided with me like a kite
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
The girl collided with me like a kite
She pulled my heart in such a way that
She has clung to me
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
The girl collided with me like a kite
Like a flying kite, completely carefree
I'm under such an intoxication of fun
She feels like a current, like a warrant
She feels like a downloaded torrent from the net
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
The girl collided with me like a kite
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
Like the blooming spring, like a washed stain
Like heart cracks filled by the cement of love
Like a war going on through the eyes
Like receiving a long pending refund
She has become part of my speech
The girl has become part of my speech
She is in my blood
The girl is in my blood
She's crazy like stories, she's wild like youth
She freezes and melts every moment like water
She flows like speed, she's naughty as well
She's all over me like great kindness
She pulled my heart in such a way that
She has clung to me
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
The girl collided with me like a kite
Sometimes she cuts the strings of kites
Sometimes she jumps over rooftops
She passes the crossroads of my heart
Sometimes she smiles
Sometimes she runs in the streets
She takes my heart away with a smile
(French verse)
She has affected me like intoxication
She collided with me like a kite
She has affected me like intoxication
The girl has affected me like intoxication
