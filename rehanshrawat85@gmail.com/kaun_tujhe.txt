I can feel you in me whenever I breathe.
The crossway of your heart,
I pass through every day.
You tease me like the free wind.
and I aberrate like loose sand.
Who’ll love you as much
as I love you.
The quest of my vision stops with you.
What more is left to express?
Nothing is left unsaid.
My eyes long for your eyes.
and you’re unaware of that.
I gaze at your eyes while hiding my feelings from you.
Who’ll love you as much as I love you.
As you came in my life, My dreams has gone mad
I am not able to hold the moment. The fly around carefree.
You’re the reason for my smile. You’re the reason for my laugh.
and you’re unaware of that.
The day I am not able catch a glimpse of You.
I wander around like a mad person.
Who’ll love you as much
as I love you
