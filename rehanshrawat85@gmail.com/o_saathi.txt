O God, you've made me capable to bear this pain
You've turned the storm into a shore for the boat
After gathering all the restlessness of the world
When nothing more could be made, you created my heart
O partner, the traveller is unable to see the path without you
O partner, the shore is foggy without you
When I close my eyes then they search for someone
I'm unable to sleep
I'm unable to sleep
The drops of my desires are searching for someone
I'm unable to sleep
I'm unable to sleep
I'm unable to weave any sleep
I'm unable to weave any sleep
O God, you've made me capable to bear this pain
You've turned the storm into a shore for the boat
After gathering all the restlessness of the world
When nothing more could be made, you created my heart
O partner, the traveller is unable to see the path without you
O partner, the shore is foggy without you
