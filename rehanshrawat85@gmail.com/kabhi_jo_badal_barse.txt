If the clouds pour rain
Then I'll look at you till my eyes get tired
You seem like a prayer of the first rain to me
I'll live by your side
I'll call myself mad
Beloved I'll bear whatever you give me, sorrow or joy
I don't have anyone here other than you
All my destinations are right here
Come close and erase all the distances
I want to share myself with you
Take a peek in me to see who I am
You've never given me any sorrows
Then why did you leave me alone
The moments of love that we spent together
After making you mine forever
Then why did you change your style, why did you do this
If the clouds pour rain
Then I'll look at you till my eyes get tired
You seem like a prayer of the first rain to me
I'll live by your side
I'll call myself mad
Beloved I'll bear whatever you give me, sorrow or joy
