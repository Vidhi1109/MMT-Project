How should I tell and express
I want to live in you till the morning
This drenched smile of the wet lips
I want to drink it in this drinking weather
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love ... I've got used it
I've got used it ... I've got used it
Our emotions
Are connecting with each other
I'm yearning for you in such a way
That I've started to lose my consciousness
I find peace in your arms
It's comfortable like paradise
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love ... I've got used it
I've got used it ... I've got used it
Why are they so different and unique
These styles of yours
Spontaneously every evening
I embrace your shadow
Every moment that passes in your vicinity
Is like a prayer
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love
Let me tell you one thing, if you permit me
I've got used to your love ... I've got used it
I've got used it ... I've got used it
