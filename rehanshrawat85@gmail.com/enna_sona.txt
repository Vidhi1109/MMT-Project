Why did God create you so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful
So beautiful, so beautiful
When she is close to me, I feel her warmth
When she goes away, my heart burns
Which fire has God used to create you
To create you, to create you
Why did God create you so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful
So that you don't feel the heat of the hot moon
I'll shower dew drops the whole night
God has taken great pains to create you
To create you, to create you
Why did God create you so beautiful
Why did God create you so beautiful
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
I persuade my lover whenever I come or go
So beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful
