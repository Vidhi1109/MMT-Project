Silences are sounds,
Sometime, come to listen..
They'll blossom by just touching you,
Sometime call them home.
They're restless to talk to you,
Let them speak..
Silences, yours and mine,
Silences, wrapped around us, silences..
Have you been to that street ever (again)
That the world hasn't passed by for long..
My time is stuck there only,
What do I tell you what has hardened with me..
Silences are a musical instrument,
You bring some tune,
Silences are words,
Come, sometime hum it with me..
They're restless to talk,
Let them speak for a bit..
Even the river water flows silently here,
There are a million silences hidden in blossoming moonlight..
Where do raindrops ever have tongues,
In burning hearts, there is for rising silently..
Silences are sky,
Come, come to fly..
Silences are feelings,
Do you feel them?
They're restless to talk to you,
Let them speak..
