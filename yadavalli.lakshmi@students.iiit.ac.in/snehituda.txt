Yesterday in Munimapulu… Yesterday in Munimapulu
Sleep in your skin
If the wind floats it... if it sways like this
In the marks of the midnight beauty of Anandala
Call you... let us cry
In the rings of the Kurus... in the black dots
In the rings of the Kurus... in the black dots
Pride... My pride
Friend friend… secret friend
Just my little wishes... Entwined friend
This is all... this is the net victory
Veda that shines till the end of breath
The bond of life is the gift of all desires
Friend friend… secret friend
You can reach a small limit
In this life, you will wear flowers
As soft as devotees who cut flowers
If I sleep the tender nails are Gillavoi
I will accompany you on the road
Open five fingers… apply cow butter
What are the services?
Friend friend… secret friend
Just my little wishes... Entwined friend
You slept in Munimapulu yesterday
If the wind floats or sways like this
In the marks of the midnight beauty of Anandala
Call you... let us cry
In the rings of the Kurus... in the black dots
In the rings of the Kurus... in the black dots
Pride... My pride
You have to calm down, what is the work of the day?
It's a day's work to calm down
You can bring it to your own
Wale Poddu Valape
The woolen shirt is dry
Even a trickle of water will come to me
My mother is covered with salt
As it is, it will be picked up and thrown away
I will hide you in the corners, aaa
A friend a friend a secret friend
Just my little wishes... Entwined friend
This is all... this is the net victory
Veda that shines till the end of breath
The bond of life is the gift of all desires
Friend friend… secret friend
Just my little wishes... Entwined friend
