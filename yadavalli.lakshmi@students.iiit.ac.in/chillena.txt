A little…
A raindrop…
wet me girl
Wings…
Who gave…
My heart is flying...
Before…

In your eyes...
ohhh…
I live…
Girl…
By your dreams… ho…
I changed…
Honey...

Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…

Oh my goodness...
My scenery is...
Don't laugh…
My darling...
In Kammakarai…
You are not shipwrecked….

Can't see...
Can you please...
hand in hand…
Won't you go... ah... ah...

Take a look...
Talk a little...
That my eyes…
Oh my…
Curse me…
Summer rains…
After coming and going...
Road side tree...
Water drops by itself...

Me…
The storm that hits...
The sun dries up at night...
Oh… oh… oh…
because of you
because of you
Unpublished…
I became windy…
Foot girl…
Hit me...
If I fall…
Your feet are sore...

In your eyes...
ohhh…
I live…
Girl…
With your dreams...
I changed…
Honey...

A little…
A raindrop…
wet me girl
Wings…
Who gave…
My heart is flying...
Before… ah…

When love comes...
After the fever...
Again I survive…
Give me kisses…
Anger also in principle…
Once again you…
Do you look angry...

Takes...
beautiful…
Even the shadow…
Copy of Beauty…
One day…
no less…
Oh ho…
The new addiction…
Look at me... ah...
Although off…
Unstoppable… a… a…
A fire…
The place is right…

The place is right…

I danced…
Girl…
A thunder shower...

Thunderstorm...

You hit me…
Before…

Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
Oh oh oh…
