Narmada is full of me..
Lotus in the water..
It changed like the seasons..
Child because of you....
The star of these years..
A gift of golden flowers..
Om Peace Peace Om Peace
My life is all you..
You are my breath
Chelimene is you..

Narmada is full of me..
Lotus in the water..
It changed like the seasons..
Child because of you...

Something hit me
The tip of the nose is pointed
The tinfoil melts
Shut up and indulge yourself
No matter where you stand, how much it costs
Every path you walk on becomes a nightmare
Come with me and see my house
She admires me without knowing who she is
Don't get lost behind that
Is this a dream or reality?
My mind is free to you...

Narmada is full of me..
Lotus in the water..
It changed like the seasons..
Child because of you...
The star of these years..
A gift of golden flowers..

The sleep of my eyes was stolen...
All hopes go away..
If you are passing by...
Wind direction changed..
If you are waiting, my legs will stop
All the flowers will live in your head
A hug is not a hug if you don't want one
My whole life is with you
This is the minute I think about
If you don't think there is no
My heart can't stand it

Narmada is full of me..
Lotus in the water..
It changed like the seasons..
Child because of you...
The star of these years..
A gift of golden flowers..
Om Peace Peace Om Peace
My life is all you..
You are my breath
