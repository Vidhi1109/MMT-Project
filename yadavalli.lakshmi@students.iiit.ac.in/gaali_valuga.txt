The wind is like a rose
The wounded one hit my heart
Missing every moment
Like this for you
Wear it and say it like this
If found, your friendship

What are the clouds in the flowers?
In a jar of wet honey
Write sandalwood to the winds of Munchesave
Throw up
What will you do lightning swords?
Jump and lie on top
Cut it into pieces
Increase the desire

How about tying the knot?
Even an atom is precious
Stand up, stand up, baby
Allah flies like a kite
Don't go alone

Just look at the wind
Oh rose

The wounded one hit my heart
Missing every moment
Like this for you
Wear it and say it like this
If found, your friendship

A lot of anger
What is the sin of regretting Ar?
It's okay, you're a ghoul
Urvashi was spinning like that
Oh, that's how you smile and grow your mustache

After all these years, it's just in imagination
Don't let it go
Look back and forth
Let's sit down and think
Let's kill the war
Let's compromise a little
How difficult is it for you?

How about tying the knot?
Even an atom is precious
Stand up, stand up, baby
Allah flies like a kite
Don't go alone

What to do in the wind
Oh rose
The wounded one hit my heart
Missing every moment
Like this for you
Wear it and say it like this
If found, your friendship
