I want to call you mom again

It's the age of a baby.. It starts again

Together until the ground is covered

Witness the stars that blow in the wind

If you want, mom

Don't leave me mom

You are gold

I want to call you mom again

It's the age of a baby.. It starts again

You are hungry before asking

What stories do you hear, Jabilammawai?

Together until the ground is covered

Witness the stars that blow in the wind

If you want, mom

Don't leave me mom

You are gold

Little by little, the world has become ours

Did you compare your search results?

Like the apple of your eye, which is like an eyelid

Is there a dawn for us who spread the pains?

Together until the ground is covered

Witness the stars that blow in the wind

If you want, mom

Don't leave me mom

You are gold

How much your baby brain is growing

Take pity and stay with us

After all, if God has a mother's heart

Give you a new birth instead

Together until the ground is covered

Witness the stars that blow in the wind

If you want, mom

Don't leave me mom

You are gold
