Two-letter love is what gave life to creation
The human address that has been purged in your womb
Two-letter love is what gave life to creation
The human address that has been purged in your womb
Your form is the measure of all living things
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Atomic atomic endurance with pain
In a parent figure
Forget the nine months of suffering with a smile
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Two-letter love is what gave life to creation
The human address that has been purged in your womb
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Squeeze the fat in the dung and pour the drops of oil ..
To light the toddlerâ€™s life lights
The broken child tightened as the front kissed
Breathing once tears the eyelids
Kanna is a mother who stands full of love and stands as a witness
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Two-letter love gave life to creation.
The human address that has been purged in your womb
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Mother Mother Mother Mother
Two-letter love is what gave life to creation
The human address that has been purged in your womb
