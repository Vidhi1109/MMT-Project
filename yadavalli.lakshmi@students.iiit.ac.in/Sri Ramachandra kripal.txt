O Mind! Pray to compassionate Ramachandra who destroys the great fears of life. With eyes like a new lotus, with a face like a lotus, and feet like a crimson lotus.

With boundless splendour like innumerable cupids, he is as beautiful as a new blue cloud. I bow to that groom of Janakaâ€™s daughter, who is like a lustrous white lightning in his yellow garments. 

I bow to the Sun-like friend of the wretched,  destroyer of the demons & dynasties. Son of the Raghu dynasty, root of joy, gladdens the Kosalas,  son of Dasharatha.

Beautiful with a crown on his head, earrings, and mark on his forehead and limbs generously decorated. With long hands to his knees, holding a bow and arrow , winner of the battle with khara and dhUshaNa.

Thus says tulasIdAsa. He who pleases the minds of Shankara and Adisesha, who has contempt for the wicked things like desire, please dwell in the lotus of my heart.
