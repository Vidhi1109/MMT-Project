After breaking-up, what remains of us is not sufficient enough to live.
A fragment of sunlight inside me is filled with dewdrops.
We were supposed to be knotted in a relationship, but before we could build a strong bond, it was already over between us.
It feels like our relationship was like a text chalked on a wall that got washed as it rained.
When we broke apart so little was left.
A fragment of sunlight filled with dewdrops.
Are shattered dreams worth living for?
Are false promises worth chasing?
I made my mind up to find myself again
I must now follow my heart.
All the glamour and beauty I had, it came from you.
Even when my mind was in the abyss, I was thinking of you.
It was hard for me to start to live without you, as I was too used to your company.
It’s like while being alive, I have passed out.
Would you like to think of how happy we were,
and what we have turned into now?
I am cremated in the nights of grieves.
You showed me, love, would you tell like, was that love real?
Never mind, you don’t have to say how much you loved me.
The journey we are about to share is not for long.
A fragment of sunlight inside me is filled with dewdrops.
After breaking-up, what left of us is not sufficient enough to live. A fragment of sunlight inside me is filled with dewdrops.
