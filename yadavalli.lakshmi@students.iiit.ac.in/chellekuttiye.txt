Who is this?
Looked for
waiting
my love
into the eyes
Here's the breeze
Just saw
Here is the electricity
My darling
The apple of my eye
The anger you show is love
to call you
give a kiss
My heart aches
Silence in the eyes
The passion of the word
Is this anger necessary dear?
Breath speed
Heavy in speech
Bear with me dear
my girlfriend
You have also touched the untouchable
I am also in lockdown
do you cry
Those clouds will come down
Your eyes will wipe
My darling
The apple of my eye
The anger you show is love
to call you
give a kiss
My heart aches, oh...
