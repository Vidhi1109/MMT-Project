He will never open his hood
She does not tell her secret to anyone
Why it happened is a long story
It does not give way to escape
There is no reason to be wrong
It's fun to get into trouble
Instead, what is the collision of questions that do not look like this
What if the minds of the people who don't stop art change
There was a commotion inside yesterday
Something happened today
Did you feel it at all?
He will never reveal his secret
He does not tell his secret to anyone
Why it happened is a long story
It does not give way to escape
There is no reason to be wrong
It's fun to get into trouble
You are so strange
I will show you incomparable
Some are accusing us of not being the same as before
It is clear whether it is true or not
If some people congratulate you by celebrating and showing you
How do you know whether to laugh or sigh?
Instead, what is the collision of questions that do not look like this
What if the minds of the people who don't stop art change
You have changed from yesterday to today
Your journey will turn to a new shore
Change is coming before you know it
If someone is telling you, how can you believe it?
If the path is thorny, notice that
How are these people who move forward in haste?
Instead, what is the collision of questions that do not look like this
What if the minds of the people who don't stop art change
