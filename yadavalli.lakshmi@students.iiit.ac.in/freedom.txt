Hey, we're old, we're hot

The right to shine is ours, the speed of the Veda is ours

The blood that boils is ours

This doctrine is ours to win

No one knows the fear

The mantra of youth is made made madele

Freedom is ours

Freedom is the mantra for the youth

Freedom is ours

If we do Freedom touch, we will do it


Write a white paper life

Whatever is eternal is eternal glory

You are a famous Telugu hero who is famous for your story

Hey, if anyone is standing next to you

If you believe in yourself, the world is yours

Freedom is ours

Freedom is the mantra for the youth

Freedom is ours

If we do Freedom touch, we will do it


Hey, the hope of many is the breath of a few

One hundred and twenty thousand of it

If you write anything, you will look for it in any corner

If your look is a word, then the word is a wave

Aren't you the source of the story that someone writes?

Freedom is ours

Freedom is the mantra for the youth

Freedom is ours

If we do Freedom touch, we will do it
