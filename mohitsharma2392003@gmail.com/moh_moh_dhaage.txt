these threads of attachment,
have got entangled in your fingers
I seem to get no clue,
how to solve open this knot..
every particle of my body is a musical instrument,
that passes through the clouds..
you must be a little mad, that you have chosen me..
how, how did you listen to everything that was unsaid..
you are like a day, I am night.
come let’s meet like they both meet in the evening..
this heart wasn’t so carefree earlier..
letters seem to have found
a new address..
this heart wasn’t so carefree earlier..
on the empty street, I walk with my eyes closed,
I’ll reach at least somewhere even if for no reason..
