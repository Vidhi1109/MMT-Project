We’ve never seen one with such beauty as she
Hers is the beauty of the sculptured idols of Ajanta
Her beauty has bewitched our gaze
Her beauty is an alluring song
Her beauty is a heady fragrance
Hers is the beauty of scented moonlight
Hers is the beauty of a haunting melody
Hers is the beauty of a blossoming garden
Hers is the beauty of the first light of dawn
Hers is the most exquisitely hewn beauty
Warm and smooth as sandalwood
Pure and delicate as marble
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Whoever sees her must succumb to her spell
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
I don’t know what enchantment your gaze wrought
My heart became drawn to you irresistibly
The bright dawn of my face, the dusky twilight of my tresses
All that was mine is now devoted to you
Your eyes met mine
And ever since then a spell has been woven
I feel that I have become beautiful
Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator!
Her face is fresh as a flower
Is it her face in its brilliance or is it the moon itself?
Her face is sheer poetry
Her face has the beauty of the lotus flower
Her face is an artist’s thought and also its translation
Her face is both dream and realisation
Her face is some magical tale
Her face is both certainty and supposition
Her face is like no other seen anywhere
Splendidly luminous, dazzlingly radiant
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Whoever sees her must succumb to her spell
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator! Praise to her Creator!
It is impossible to describe that beautiful beloved
Praise to her Creator!
Praise to her Creator!
