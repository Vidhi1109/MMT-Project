My Heart full of Feelings,
Was stolen by you.
I am alone without you.
You are my path and destination.
 
You are my heartbeat and my life,
My soul belongs with you.
I can't take my eyes off your face.
Your eyes keep me engaged.
 
You are my world,
Your smile is apart from anyone else's,
You are my everything.
You are my soul.
 
Your eyes, when they look at me,
It seems like the wind starts to blow,
You are my only true love,
Ask the starts they know it all.
 
You are my mornings and my nights,
I will become yours.
I wish I would always say your name,
And my name would be taken with you.
