You told me to smile
I kept smiling
You told me to dance
I kept dancing
You told me that I look good while I cry
I'll dance on the fire in front of you
By fullfilling your arrow like dreams
My dreams have become empty like arrow quiver
Whole Life I kept on being a Joker
And my life became circus
How well you taught me to live is just amazing
To breath while I drink poison, you wounded my heart
You taught me not to cry nor you let me to stitch my wounds
Instead of taking one breath
I breath by breaking it into two
Now my limits of pain are crossed
Whole Life I kept on being a Joker
My life became circus
Clouds, earth
With me the whole surrounding cry
The much I love you
You hate me that much
My darling, you will remember me poor person
One day will come, you see
When you spirit will be in my control
Whole Life I kept on being a Joker
And my life became circus
