When you came then I remembered
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
When you came then I remembered
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
When you came then I remembered
The moon has come out in the street
These eyes are yearning without the kohl
It's raining all the twelve months
God has listened to my prayer
God has listened to my prayer
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
When you came then I remembered
The moon has come out in the street
Had I slept tonight
Then my eyes would've opened in the morning
I would've been destroyed
I would've been destroyed
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
I saw you coming
I saw my life leaving
What all didn't happen after that
What all didn't happen after that
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
The moon has come out in the street
After so many days
The moon has come out in the street
