The sun has dimmed down
The moon has become brighter
Oh, why did the sky
Begin to melt
The sun has dimmed down
The moon has become brighter
Oh, why did the sky
Begin to melt
I was standing still
The earth started to move
My heart was beating
My breath got deeper
Oh is this my first love
My beloved is this my first love
Oh o o o ... aa aa aa
The sun has dimmed down
The moon has become brighter
Oh, why did the sky
Begin to melt
I was standing still
The earth started to move
My heart was beating
My breath got deeper
Oh is this my first love
My beloved is this my first love
La la la ... la la la ... lal lala
La la la ... la la la ... lal lala
These moments are beautiful
Everything is changing
The dreams are blending into reality
Is this old and since ages
This relationship of ours
Is that the reason why I'm meeting you like this
Let it stay forever
This season of love
Meet me like this
From birth to birth
Hmmm ... I was standing still
The earth started to move
La la la ... la la la
My heart was beating
My breath got deeper
Oh is this my first love
My beloved is this my first love
(Whistling)
It's with your colour
That I've been coloured my beloved
Having achieved you
I'm losing myself my beloved
Oh my lover in your love
I'm drowning and crossing my beloved
The ocean became thirsty
The night started to wake up
Even in the hearts of embers
There was a fire burning
I was standing still
The earth started to move
My heart was beating
My breath got deeper
Is this my first love
My beloved is this my first love
The sun has dimmed down
The moon has become brighter
Oh, why did the sky
Begin to melt
Let the sun continue to burn
Let the moon stay dimmed
This dream is difficult
So we won't be united
