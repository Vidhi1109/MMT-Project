Hey ... la la la la la
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
The problem is that
She stays somewhat detached from me
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
Since the day I've seen her
I've forgotten to light the lamp
Since the day I've seen her
I've forgotten to light the lamp
I'm just sitting clutching my heart
I've forgotten about coming and going
Now constantly in my eyes
That playful face remains
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
Even the rain came and left
Even the clouds thundered and rained
Even the rain came and left
Even the clouds thundered and rained
But for one glimpse of her
I kept yearning, o god of beauty
When will the thirst of my eyes quench
Day and night this worry remains
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
The problem is that
She stays somewhat detached from me
In the window across from me
A piece of the moon lives
