My days end here
My mornings begin here
I'll live and die here
This is my temple and my Medina
My days end here
My mornings begin here
I'll live and die here
This is my temple and my Medina
Your lanes
Your lanes
I like them
Your lanes
Your lanes
Your lanes
Make me agonize
Your lanes
You sleep in my sleep
You cry in my teardrops
Your whisper is in my thoughts
You're there even when you're not there
Your the result ... aa aa
Of my pain ... aa aa
These are the prayers of my heart
Your lanes
Your lanes
I like them
Your lanes
Your lanes
Your lanes
Make me agonize
Your lanes
What is our relationship
It has no face but still it's deep
These moments are silky
We should not lose them
This caravan ... aa aa
Of time ... aa aa
Stop it so that it doesn't separate from the heart
Your lanes
Your lanes
I like them
Your lanes
Your lanes
Your lanes
Make me agonize
Your lanes
