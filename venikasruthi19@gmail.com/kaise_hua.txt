Why does meeting you makes me smile, nowadays.
Why is there a sudden change in my attitude, nowadays.
My eyes look for you everywhere, without any reason.
Is this really me or someone else.
How did it happen?
How did you become so important (or essential) to me?
I did not use to understand the language of the rains.
Neither I used to clash with the winds.
There is heart in my chest.
Where did I know about that.
My nights pass somewhere and mornings elsewhere.
Only vagrancy ( or homelessness) accompanied me all along.
To stay, To stay,
Your eyes ask me to stay.
What have I become in love?
My eyes look for you everywhere, for no reason.
Is this really me or someone else disguised as me.
How did it happen?
How did you become so essential to me.
I can’t stop smiling every time I see you.
I wonder why there’s a change in my attitude.
Everywhere I look, I only wish to see you.
Is this really me?
Or is this someone else?
How did it happen?
How did you become my necessity?
I don’t get what rains are trying to tell me.
I don’t run into the winds too.
I had no clue that I too have a heart under my chest.
Wandering from place to place day and night.
Unable to tether anywhere.
But your eyes tell me to stay.
What is happening to me?
Everywhere I look, I only wish to see you.
Is this really me?
Or is this someone else?
Someone else who looks like me.
How did it happen?
How did you become my necessity?
