Never thought that you would be
Standing here so close to me
There's so much I feel that I should say
But words can wait until some other day
Kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice, then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
