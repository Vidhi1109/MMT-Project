Until I don’t burn drop by drop in your fire
 
Until I don’t walk With you to the moon
Stay near me
Don’t talk about leaving
Stay with me
Don’t talk about leaving
 
Until I don’t burn drop by drop in your fire
Until I don’t walk with you to the moon
yes, stay near me
don’t talk about leaving
 
Something that looks beautiful on you
What shall I give you like that?
All these lines on my palms, I make you wear them
