You're mine in this moment
May be tomorrow things might not be the same
What if you're no longer yourself
What if I'm no longer myself
May be our paths might get separated
May be we'll get lost while walking
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
I'll die for this love
But still I'll love you
O my life, in every silence
I'll sing songs of your love
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
I'll die for this love
But still I'll love you
You're necessary for me
Just like air is for breathing
I'll look for you
Just like the feet look for the earth
Whether I have to laugh or cry
I'll look for you like someone crazy
Whether tomorrow you're in love with me or not
Whether tomorrow I have the permission or not
Taking the pieces of my broken heart
I'll come and stay at your door
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
I'll die for this love
But still I'll love you
Since the moment you've met me
I've started to look more beautiful
Now not only do I smile from my lips
But I smile with my entire body
My days and nights are beautiful
All of this is due to you
This companionship won't be there forever
You might be in some place and I might be in some place
But whenever you'll remember me
I'll come like the winds
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
I'll die for this love
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
But still I'll love you
