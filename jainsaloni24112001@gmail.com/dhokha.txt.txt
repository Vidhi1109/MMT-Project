You're punishing me for loving you wholeheartedly
I'm crying and you're enjoying that
I'll complain about you after embracing you
I'll complain about you after embracing you
I'll point out your mistakes once more to you
I'm going far away, will you call me back
I'm going far away, will you call me back
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you listen to my prayers if you're not there in my heart
Will you listen to my prayers if you're not there in my heart
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
You looted me without me even knowing about it
You looted me without me even knowing about it
You intoxicated me and didn't even make that as a habit
You intoxicated me and didn't even make that as a habit
Will you give me the account for all your lootings
Will you give me the account for all your lootings
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you tell me how should I leave you
Will you tell me how should I leave you
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Count and tell me how many times I've been stabbed in my back
Count it carefully unfaithful one, as you might forget counting
If you want to see me then enter in my heart
And don't get surprised when you see your photo in there
Will you feel sad if I burn your photo
Will you feel sad if I burn your photo
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you listen to my prayers if you're not there in my heart
Will you listen to my prayers if you're not there in my heart
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
Will you get upset if I called you a cheater
My love story wasn't bad at all
It's just that some characters like you turned out to be con artists
