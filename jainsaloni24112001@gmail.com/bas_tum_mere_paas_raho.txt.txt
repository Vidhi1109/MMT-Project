This Is Your First Post
In Our Baton
Every Person Who Is Always Met.
That’s All There Is To It
The Face Is Visible
I Am Out Of Our Sight

What Is The Heart?
Don’t Be My Door
Just Stay With Me
Just Stay With Me

What Is The Heart?
Don’t Be My Door
Just Stay With Me
Oh Just Stay With Me

Complain No Matter What
No Matter What You Do
Just Be With Me
Just Stay With Me

I Am Very Compelled
Every Lama From My Heart
Jahan Ki Raunak Mai Bhi
Without Thee I Remain Alone.

What Is The Heart?
Don’t Be My Door
Just Stay With Me
Just Stay With Me

Complain No Matter What
No Matter What You Do
Just Be With Me
Just Stay With Me

My God, One Moment, Every Moment.
I Will Be Waiting For You
Your Lord Is From The Stars
Copied For My Sake

What Is The Heart?
Don’t Be My Door
Just Stay With Me
Just Stay With Me

Complain No Matter What
No Matter What You Do
Just Be With Me
Just Stay With Me
