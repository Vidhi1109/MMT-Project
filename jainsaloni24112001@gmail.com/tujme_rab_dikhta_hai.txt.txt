You're my heaven
You're my passion
You're my wish
You're are the peace of my soul
You're the soothing of my eyes
You're the beat of my heart
And I know nothing else
I know only this
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
My head bows down in worship to you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
What kind of distance is this
What kind of helplessness is this
I've touched you through my eyes
O ho o ... sometimes your fragrance
Sometimes your conversations
I've achieved this world without asking
You're the brightness in my heart
You're the wealth of multiple births
And I know nothing else
I know only this
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
My head bows down in worship to you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
Resides, resides, resides
She resides in my heart
Smiles, smiles, smiles
She smiles although her heart cries
God has made this pair ... hey
Resides, resides, resides
She resides in my heart
Smiles, smiles, smiles
She smiles although her heart cries
You come with a ringing sound
You make me long
I tease your shadow and kiss it
O ho o ... when you smile
When you feel shy
It seems that my God is dancing
You're my blessing
You're my prayer
And I know nothing else
I know only this
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
My head bows down in worship to you
My beloved what should I do
I see God in you
My beloved what should I do
Resides, resides, resides
She resides in my heart
Smiles, smiles, smiles
She smiles although her heart cries
God has made this pair ... hey
