Like the lead dancer dancing at a local goddess’s festival
Like an aggressive bull jumping in the dust of the fields
Like the main dancer dancing at the festival of a local goddess
Like playing with the stick while wearing wooden slippers

Like a bunch of young boys gathering in the shade of a banyan tree
Like eating a roti jowar with a chilli.
Listen to my song. Listen to my song.
Listen to my song.

Naatu Naatu Naatu, Crazy Naatu.

Naatu Naatu Naatu. Wild Naatu.

Naatu like a green chili.
Naatu like a sharp dagger.

Like beating a drum that makes your heart beat faster
Like the shrill voice of a bird that can ring your ears
Like singing a song that can make your fingers snap to the beat
Like the wild dance when there’s a fast beat

Like the dance that makes your body sweat
Listen to my song. Listen to my song.
Listen to my song.

Naatu Naatu Naatu. Crazy Naatu.
Naatu Naatu Naatu. Wild Naatu.

Naatu like a green chili.
Naatu like a sharp dagger.
Dance so that the blood in your body

Jump violently which will shake the earth
The life force inside of you should dance with joy
So jump until the dust rises in the air. Naatu Naatu Naatu.
