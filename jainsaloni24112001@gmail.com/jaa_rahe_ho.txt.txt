listen, wet will do indifference
when you are free
But this is also a request to God
never get time

There are two turns from here
think where you want to go
On one side I am your dream
you tell me whatever the decision is

going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams
Till today my life was for you
If you ask tomorrow, I will not give you an evening

going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams

How do you make me smile by giving me pain
Where do you get such shamelessness from?
The love that you have learned here from me
How do you try that love on others

until i'm back to being myself
I swear on my heart that I will not rest

going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams
going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams

Despite being in front of me, you are my second place
your heart knows you are unfaithful
To be honest, I haven't committed the crime
You are the punishment I will bear for the rest of my life

I will not show you this face of mine
Now until I stop holding someone's hand

going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams
Till today my life was for you
If you ask tomorrow, I will not give you an evening

going away but remember you
I will not take your name even in my dreams
I will not take your name even in my dreams

True heart was hurt unknowingly
made me famous
