You have yet to fall in love; I have already fallen in love and am well acquainted with it.
Except for my heart, I have no desire for anyone’s acceptance.
Only the privileged are equipped with the skills of love.
I rescued the enemy at the expense of my own life.

Many individuals like talking. Many people!
Friends, I know what’s genuine. My friends!

Many individuals like talking, but I have expertise.
I can even make the wind stop. The Lord pours forth his prayers on you.

Pathan steals all hearts when he gets into the groove, my love.
He’ll keep the promises he makes to you, my love.

When Pathan gets into the groove, my love, he steals all hearts.
The promises he makes, my dear, he’ll stand by forever.

I’ll tell you how to compete this time.
I’ll show you how to do it.

I’ll teach you how to love your adversary this time.
I’ll tell you how to compete this time. I’ll show you how to do it.

If my beloved gives me a signal… A signal…
I would lose my heart again… Again…

If my sweetheart gives me a sign, I’ll give her my heart twice.
Friendship has cast its spell; even foes come to me for an embrace.

My darling, Pathan captures everyone’s hearts when he finds his rhythm.
He will always keep his promises, my darling.

Pathan captures all hearts when he gets into the rhythm, my love.
He’ll keep the commitments he makes to you, my love.
