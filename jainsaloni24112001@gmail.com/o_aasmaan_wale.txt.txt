How many times would loved ones be parted?
I hope no one falls in love in the future.
Why did you do it, Creator of the World?
You gave me a heart, so why did you also give me pain?

Why don’t you realize the tears welling up in my eyes?
Oh ruler of the skies above, come down, and feel it for yourself.
Oh king of the heavens above, Come on earth and experience it for yourself.
What does it feel like to be separated from a loved one; why don’t you try it for yourself?

Oh ruler of the skies above, come down, and feel it for yourself.
Oh heavenly ruler, come down and experience it.

There’s a big difference between you and me, oh almighty.
You have no idea how much pain memories can cause.

You would not have put your hand on your chest while suffering from the agony of love.
Have you ever spent the night crying like I did?

Like my heart…
Why don’t you shatter into pieces and feel the same as my heart?

Oh ruler of the skies above, come down, and feel it for yourself.
Oh heavenly ruler, come down and experience it for yourself.

Many of the stars fell; many people were abandoned.
Many people have drowned as a result of this love illness.

Many souls have been separated from their bodies as a result of your actions.
You’ve shattered a lot of delicate hearts.

You will, too, cry.
If you count, your eyes, too, will cry.

Oh ruler of the skies above, come down, and feel it for yourself.
Oh heavenly ruler, come down and experience it for yourself.
Try being separated from a loved one for yourself and feel it for yourself.

Oh ruler of the skies above, come down, and feel it for yourself.
Oh heavenly ruler, come down and experience it for yourself.
