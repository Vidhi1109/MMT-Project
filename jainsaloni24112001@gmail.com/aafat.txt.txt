You have offered me a drink by your eyes
I will drink it but how can I go to my home
I will fall down here
You Have Offered Me A Drink By Your Eyes
I Will Drink It But How Can I Go To My Home
I Will Fall Down Here
When You Move
And When You Groove
You Just Make Judgment
Your Youngness Is A Such A Trouble
Yes Its Trouble
Please Leave Me For God Sake
I Cannot Walk
I Cannot Handle Myself
If I Don’t Come In Your Arms
Where Should I Go
You Are Not Going To Get Out Of This And, So I
If You Will Touch Me
I’ll Get Burn
You Are Like Water And I Am Fire
Where Are You Going Sweetheart
Please Come In My Arms
Your Youngness Is A Such A Trouble
Your Youngness Is A Trouble
Its Trouble
Leave Me, Leave Me
Your Youngness Is A Trouble
