Oh, dear. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
The intoxicating night has arrived, and everything about it is intoxicating.
Come over and get a little tipsy.
Our meeting is mesmerizing. This rain is entrancing.
Come on, get a little tipsy with me.
Oh, dear. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh, my beautiful. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
The intoxication from this moment will last until the next morning.
Let us live in the present moment. What is the significance of making a promise for tomorrow?
I’ve only poured the drink for you.
Oh, dear. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh, my beautiful. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
When compared to my mesmerizing eyes, the intoxication of the drinks from goblets is less effective.
The intoxication of goblets is less effective than my mesmerizing eyes.
Guests’ hearts want to dive into my hypnotic eyes.
Only for you have I shattered my admirers’ dreams.
Oh, dear. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh, my beautiful. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
The intoxicating night has arrived, and everything about it is intoxicating.
Come over and get a little tipsy.
Our meeting is mesmerizing. This rain is entrancing.
Come on, get a little tipsy with me.
Oh, dear. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
Oh, my beautiful. Oh, my darling. Oh, my sweetheart.
