The heads that have the shade of love
Heaven will be under their feet
The heads that have the shade of love
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
In the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
In the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
That friend who is like fragrance
Whose language is like urdu
She's my day, my night and my universe
That friend of mine is my beloved
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Sometimes the flowers show their pride
But when it fragrances, it can be seen
Sometimes the flowers show their pride
But when it fragrances, it can be seen
I'll wear her as a sacred locket
May I find her like a holy verse
I'll wear her as a sacred locket
May I find her like a holy verse
Sometimes the flowers show their pride
But when it fragrances, it can be seen
I'll wear her as a sacred locket
May I find her like a holy verse
That friend of mine is like my faith
She's my melody, she's my holy verse
My melody, my holy verse
My melody, my holy verse
My melody, my holy verse
My melody, my holy verse
She walks like the dew drops
Paradise seems to move with her feet
At times on branches, at times on leaves
I search for her traces in the air
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
I'm the admirer of her beauty
She's unfaithful like sunlight and shade
She's vivid and she changes her colours
I'm a trader of colour and beauty
I'm a trader of colour and beauty
The heads that have the shade of love
Heaven will be under their feet
The heads that have the shade of love
Heaven will be under their feet
She's my day, my night and my universe
That friend of mine is my beloved
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with the head in the shade of love
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Walk with your feet over the heaven
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
That friend who is like fragrance
Whose language is like urdu
She's my day, my night and my universe
That friend of mine is my beloved
Come let's walk in the shade
In the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
In the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
In the shade
Come let's walk in the shade
