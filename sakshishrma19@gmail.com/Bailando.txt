You look at me and, girl, you take me to another place (Because me need it, baby girl)
Got me feelin' like I'm flyin', like I'm out of space (Heart beat)
Something 'bout your body says, "Come and take me" (Because me need it, baby girl)
Got me begging, got me hoping that the night don't stop (Rock that body 'cause we don't stop party)


Girl, I like the way you move
Come and show me what to do
You can tell me that you want me
Girl, you got nothing to lose
I can't wait no more (Ya no puedo más)
I can't wait no more (Ya no puedo más)

You got me spinning, got me crazy, got me hypnotized (Tus latidos aceleran a mi corazón) (Heart beat)

Sexy body shape and you're full of body curves
Let me body tense to a rise up in there
Long time you're looking you fi listen my word
