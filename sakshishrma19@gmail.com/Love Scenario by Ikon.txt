We were in love
We met and became a memory that can't be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That's all I need
I loved you

The love scenario that we created
Now the lights are off
And if we flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall

I'm not really okay
Going through this breakup
Today was our yesterday and now there's no tomorrow
It hurts but if we dragged it out more, it would've become a scar
I loved you and I was loved back
So that's good enough for me

Sometimes, I'll think of the memories
If you're in it, that's good enough for me

We were in love
We met and became a memory that can't be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That's all I need
I loved you

The love scenario that we made
Now the lights are off
And if we flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall

The electric feeling in between my ribs
Your eyes that made me know I am loved
I learned so much from you, you filled up my empty half
You're too precious to just leave in the past

Sometimes, I'll think of the memories
If you're in it, that's good enough for me

We were in love
We met and became a memory that can't be erased
It was a commendable melodrama
A pretty good ending
That's all I need
I loved you

I already miss you but I'm trying not to
I'll remember you like a warm spring in a movie

The love scenario that we made
Now the lights are off
When you flip the last page
The curtains will quietly fall (Woo)

We went through pain (Oh, hey!)
We got jealous too, so funny (Hey, hey, oh!)
We loved like crazy (I ain't gonna love ya)
That's good enough for us (I was your love)

We were in love
We met
That's good enough
I loved you
