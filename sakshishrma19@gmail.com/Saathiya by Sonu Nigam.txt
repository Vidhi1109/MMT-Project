My beloved, my beloved
Your lightly drenched laughter
My beloved, my beloved
On hearing that, I drank all of it
May you always keep smiling
May your lipstick of shyness bloom
On your neck below the hair
May morning and evening be found
May you always keep smiling
May your lipstick of shyness bloom
On your neck below the hair
May morning and evening be found
May your fragranced smile
Always remain and keep blooming
Wearing yellow sunlight
Don't go in the gardens
All the bees will tease you
Don't go in the flowers
Laugh lightly, once again
Laugh once again in a lovely way
Just like a freshly fallen leaf
Lying on a green lawn
There are seven colours of the spring
Wrapped in a single style of yours
The clouds and the rain are due to you
Keep smiling in all the seasons
Keep laughing lightly
My beloved, my beloved
Your lightly drenched laughter
My beloved, my beloved
On hearing that, I drank all of it
Sometimes on the blue skies
May we go for a walk
If we find a cloud
Then we'll fall on the earth like rain
Your earing has moved
At times the night is shining
At times the evening is blooming
In the refuge of your hair
May my nights pass
From your black eyes
May some shining conversation start
In exchange for one smile of yours
Take my earth
Take my sky
My beloved, my beloved
Your lightly drenched laughter
My beloved, my beloved
On hearing that, I drank all of it
May there be snowfall in the valley
May you be wrapped in wool
May there be snowfall in the valley
And may your laughter echo
May you be wrapped in wool
When you talk, the smoke will come out
Hot and bright smoke
Soft and bright smoke
