Every time I close my eyes
Oh, I always see those eyes
So I wanted to forget
All the pain since we first met
If this isn’t real, someone wake me from this dream, please
Is this destiny, are we really meant to be
Fall, falling you

Like destiny, we're just falling
You’re calling out to me calling
I can’t escape your love any more just hold me
The other half of my being
All the while I’ve been waiting
For you to take my heart with you it’s sinking
(Stay with me)
And are you living in my heart within me
(Stay with me)
With all the truth I hid so deep

Every time I close my eyes
Oh, I always see those eyes
So I wanted to forget
All the pain since we first met
If this isn’t real, someone wake me from this dream, please
Is this destiny, are we really meant to be
Fall, falling you

My heart’s beating it goes
When I look at you so close
I’m finding it hard to breathe
Even when you’re not around
Oh you’re all I think about
Oh what have you done to me

Different from the moment I first saw you
This time of fate is passing slowly
My heart was heading towards you
My heart was racing again
The faint light was turned off
But my eyes are lighting up again because of you
Feels like I’ve loved you from a long time ago
Feels like I’m being pulled by something

Every time I close my eyes
Oh, I always see those eyes
So I wanted to forget
All the pain since we first met
If this isn’t real, someone wake me from this dream, please
Is this destiny, are we really meant to be
Fall, falling you
