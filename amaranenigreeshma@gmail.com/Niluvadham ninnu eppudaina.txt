Iam noticing this strange thing newly,
of a mirror questioning me who am I ?

Iam trying to discover another strange thing
I hear someone calling my name , but i dont think its me,

Images in your eyes looks to be mine ,
Sweet words from your honey lips looks to be my name ,
Can't believe it even if you confirm they are mine !


 Every step my feet takes, goes towards you without my control
 
 Dont worry , its true , there is a change in you , for your monkey deeds are turning into beautiful dance forms

who gave you this authority to change me this much?
