the wall between us have some cracks 
there is some reason for distance
the shore is drown in seas
there is hundreds of pain in sleeping eyes
i even fall apart by collecting the thread
the love is just for meaning
all the promise made by lover in love is just fake
all the promise made by lover in love is just fake
all love is just  full of selfishness
