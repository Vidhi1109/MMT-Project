You come like the rain
Wait a moment, don't sit down yet

You come like the rain
Wait a moment, don't sit down yet
Head to toe drenched
And there's no one else, just you and me

When you're close, it feels like home
The whole world seems like a dream

This must be the effect of the rain
Or maybe it's your magic
I have no consciousness or awareness
I have no control over myself
These drops may be conspiring
To create something special
If you're with me
Then this rain is beautiful


The comfort of your hair
Like a cool breeze
The fragrance of wet earth
That comes from your breath

The comfort of your hair
Like a cool breeze
The fragrance of wet earth
That comes from your breath

Let me flow into your heart, like the rain
Don't stop these drops that fall on us today
Light or heavy, this rain
I want to get wet, that's my only wish today

This must be the effect of the rain
Or maybe it's your magic
I have no consciousness or awareness
I have no control over myself
These drops may be conspiring
To create something special
If you're with me
Then this rain is beautiful
