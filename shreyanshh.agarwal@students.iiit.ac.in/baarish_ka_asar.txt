you come like rain

Wait, don't you sit



you come like rain

Wait, don't you sit

drenched from head to toe, no one else

just you and me

I feel like my own near you

This whole place seems like a dream

Is this the effect of rain, or is it your magic?

I have no consciousness, no news, no control over myself

Drops also do some such conspiracies

If you are with me then these rains laughed



That relief of your locks, like a cool east wind

The smell of wet soil that came from your breath

That relief of your locks, like a cool east wind

The smell of wet soil that came from your breath

I keep flowing in your heart like rain

Don't stop these drops that rain on us today

light or heavy rain

It is necessary to get wet, today this is my wish

Is this the effect of rain, or is it your magic?

I have no consciousness, no news, no control over myself

Drops also do some such conspiracies

If you are with me then these rains laughed
