It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good

It's a fight between can and should

So bounce to the sound make a revolution

This is an act of war, this is the evolution
Remember those who raged before

We're the last straw

Hard to the core and we're ready for more

Rise up!
And get on the attack

Become the generation to break the camel's back!

Said, break the camel's back!

Said, break the camel's back!
Rise up!

And get on the attack

Become the generation to break the camel's back!


My patience has come to an end
"Hey there hi, I'm ready to die!"

The rare kind of guy who's willing to try

To take the big shots at the big boys

Boom boom bang, make a big noise
Shake it up I got the big toys

Ride with us we're the best of the rest

Grab the power by the neck and put it to the test

No flag on my bulletproof vest
Talk to my heart so I never gotta guess

Hear those who came before

Fear what is yet to come

Know what you're fighting for

It's why we go to war!

My patience has come to an end


My patience has come to an end
It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good

It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good
My patience has come to an end
