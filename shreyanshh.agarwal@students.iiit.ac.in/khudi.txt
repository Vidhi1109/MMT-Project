To introduce yourself to yourself
You've set out, O madman
To introduce yourself to yourself
You've set out, O madman
 
Those bygone eras are witnesses
When moths* have been burned
To introduce yourself to yourself
You've set out, O madman
 
To introduce yourself to yourself
You've set out, O madman
Those bygone eras are witnesses
When moths have been burned
 
This world has halted
Stopping doesn't sit well with you
Time also has halted
It's no one's watch in this moment
 
Those who fly with the kites of their hearts
They're joined, those friends
When the days of life are young
The nights of sorrow are aloof
 
In the clouds of dreams
You've flown, O madman
Those bygone eras are witnesses
When moths have been burned
 
Those bygone eras are witnesses
When moths have been burned
To introduce yourself to yourself
You've set out, O madman
 
Go write this story
That the world will see
Beyond the stars will be
The abode of dreams
 
Go write this story
That the world will see
Beyond the stars will be
The abode of dreams
 
The world is bent over
The smoke has dissipated
Time is stopped
We're headed off
 
The world is bent over
The smoke has dissipated
We're headed off
