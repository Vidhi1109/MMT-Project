My arms are branches my hair like rope
Hold on tight and don’t let me go
I know you with me darling I am still there
Follow my footprints and lets run somewhere
The sands of time will fall through quickly
I’ll catch them in my hands
Rain will fall my tears will pour
I’ll cry rivers for you
I’ll be waiting here
I will wait for you
Sun will shine and blind my eyes
The light will be you
I’ll be waiting here
I will wait for you
