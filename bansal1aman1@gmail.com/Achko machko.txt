A theft happened here,
To go shopping in London.
The boy named Patel went to the UK to study.

Later, the boy and girl went away,
In the club, when a good disco song played,
She will sing "Achko Machko" 

Say hello everybody,
Say hello everybody.

Father heard the news,
The boy became afraid,
The girl left the boy,
Then ran away from home.

The girl's temper rose,
Entered the disco with "yo yo",
You also dance to "yo yo" chant,
She will sing "Achko Machko" 

Say hello everybody
