The breeze that blows in the garden
Is like a melodious song that soothes the soul
The flowers that bloom in the garden
Are like the colorful notes of a beautiful symphony
Oh beloved, your graceful steps
Are like a mesmerizing dance that enchants my heart
Your eyes are like the stars that twinkle in the sky
Your smile is like the moon that illuminates the night
The sound of the peacock's call
Is like a sweet melody that fills the air
The rustling of the leaves in the wind
Is like a gentle rhythm that calms the mind
Oh beloved, your graceful steps
Are like a mesmerizing dance that enchants my heart
Your eyes are like the stars that twinkle in the sky
Your smile is like the moon that illuminates the night
The river that flows with a gentle murmur
Is like a soft tune that lulls the heart to sleep
The chirping of the birds in the trees
Is like a beautiful choir that sings in harmony
Oh beloved, your graceful steps
Are like a mesmerizing dance that enchants my heart
Your eyes are like the stars that twinkle in the sky
Your smile is like the moon that illuminates the night
Oh beloved, you are the one who brings joy to my life
Your love is like the light that brightens up my world
You are the one who completes me
And makes me feel alive and whole again
Oh beloved, your graceful steps
Are like a mesmerizing dance that enchants my heart
Your eyes are like the stars that twinkle in the sky
Your smile is like the moon that illuminates the night.
