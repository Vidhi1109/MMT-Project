Like the rainbow in clouds and the rain drop in the mud
You hid like a thorn of love in my heart.
My naughty wish is burning as my beautiful hope is unfulfilled.
Is it to raise the madness of love in me or to kill me?
You’re the girlfriend I wished for, the damsel that left me.
You’re a merciless demon and the craze in my heart.
You’re a fish-eyed beauty and a surprising sage
You’re my moonlight in the dark, come to me beloved girl.
How do I live without you? Come to me girl.
Can’t you be seen to my eyes?
I’m living in your thoughts this way
I considered you my heart beat.
Like the rainbow in clouds and the rain drop in the mud.
You hid like a thorn of love in my heart.
My naughty wish is burning as my beautiful hope is unfulfilled.
Is it to raise the madness of love in me or to kill me?
