‘I’m an eternal hermit, an ascetic in the service of Shiva.
By bearing your footsteps, this village’s happiness knows no bounds.
Along the directions of your sight, over the carpet of stars (sky), a God worth looking up to has descended. Proclaim this fact in every village and town!’
‘Not colourful, nothing fancy – he must be the wandering religious monk, he must be Shiva.
I swear on the burning blue throat, he is the person who will relieve you of curses and griefs.
From the outside, this mysterious man looks like a beggar.
The one who will conquer the world, he will not leave without helping you!
The one who is at your service, he will not abandon you’
Wherever he is, the land fertile.
Like the night watchman, when he steps, he can clear the darkness which surrounds’
‘The one who treats ice and fire the same – just like Shiva who bothers about none,
He protected us by being an iron fence.
The lord, by definition, will live up to his promise and accompany till the end.
The one who will conquer the world, he will not leave without helping you!
The one who is at your service, he will not abandon you’
