Life is like a rain of happiness,
Let’s have the heart to get drenched.
The sorrow spell shall last only for a while,
Let’s live our life to the fullest.
One who pretends to be blind shall never see the beauty of this world.
Open your eyes!
One who is bounded shall never see the horizon.
Live free!
The world is made from the dreams I dream!
The world dances nonstop to my tunes.
Come join me as I celebrate life.
Life is just ullala! Ullala!
The world is made from the dreams I dream.
The world dances nonstop to my tunes.
Come join me as I celebrate life.
Life is just surprising and equally awesome.
Listen to your heart, to what it truly wants.
To what gives you happiness & the rest of what you do can stop!
Understand your inner gut, to its gathered strength.
You are my soldiers to make the world a better place.
You got to lose something in hand to value and cherish what life throws back at you.
You got to control the desire to process, to get the world under your feet.
The world is made from the dreams I dream.
The world dances nonstop to my tunes.
Come join me as I celebrate life.
Life is just ullala! Ullala!
The world is made from the dreams I dream.
The world dances nonstop to my tunes.
Come join me as I celebrate life.
Life is just awesome.
Life is like a rain of happiness,
Let’s have the heart to get drenched.
The sorrow spell shall last only for a while,
Let’s live our life to the fullest.
