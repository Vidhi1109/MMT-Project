You gave me love in my heart.
You came into this wretched heart.
You entered this miserable heart.
There is no guide to teach love, so to teach me, oh, teacher.
There are desires saved up. Come to give all that to me, oh, teacher.
I will exchange my heart for yours.
Oh my! What feeling is this? I failed because of you!
I pretended not to like you, but I am all yours now.
Oh my! What is this sensation? Because of you, I failed!
I feigned not to like you, but I am now entirely yours.
I became a nightingale that sings your name every day.
Since you saw me, I have become very stylish.
I became a hero pen in your pocket.
With all my heart, I have become your fan.
I want to keep looking at you. I want to join hands with you.
We must go around this village together as lovers.
A grand marriage with a band concertâ€¦ 
It should be heard everywhere.
Oh my! What is this feeling? Because of you, I failed!
I faked not liking you, but I am now entirely yours.
Oh my! What is this sensation? I failed because of you!
I pretended not to like you, but I am now entirely yours.
You infused my heart with love.
You entered this miserable heart.
You instilled love in my heart.
You came into this terrible heart.
There is no handbook to teach love, so teach me, oh, teacher.
There are wishes stored up. Oh, teacher, give me all of it.
I will swap my heart for yours.
I pretended not to like you, but I am all yours now.
Oh my! What feeling is this? I failed because of you!
