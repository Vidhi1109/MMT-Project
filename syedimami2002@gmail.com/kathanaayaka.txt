He is the hero who came from the villages
To conquer the hearts of the people
He is the one who brought the gods to life
And made the common man believe in miracles
He is the king of the silver screen
A legendary actor and a great human being
He is the pride of Telugu cinema
The one and only N.T. Rama Rao
He is the one who gave voice to the voiceless
And fought for the rights of the oppressed
He is the one who stood for justice
And inspired generations to follow his path
He is the king of the silver screen
A legendary actor and a great human being
He is the pride of Telugu cinema
The one and only N.T. Rama Rao
He is the one who ruled the hearts of millions
And left an indelible mark in their lives
He is the one who lived and breathed cinema
And made it a medium to educate and entertain
He is the king of the silver screen
A legendary actor and a great human being
He is the pride of Telugu cinema
The one and only N.T. Rama Rao
He is the one who made us laugh and cry
And taught us the true meaning of life
He is the one who will always be remembered
As a true legend and an inspiration to all
He is the king of the silver screen
A legendary actor and a great human being
He is the pride of Telugu cinema
The one and only N.T. Rama Rao.
