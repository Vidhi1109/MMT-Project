Oh, these pitiful eyes of mine, they talk about you all night.
My breaths begin to break down when your memories visit me.
Yes, I’m head over heels in love with you.
My whole universe revolves around you.
Lost my body and soul to you, o gentle beloved.
You cling on to my heart, like I’ve known you all along.
You seem like a Goddess, you’re most precious to me.
It seems that your beauty has enchanted me. My heart has been lost.
You are both my desire and my love.
You are the one who makes my heart feel better.
You are my tranquility and my passion.
You have become my obsession. You filled me with ecstasy.
It is unacceptable to me to live without you.
It is pointless to live without you.
Yes, I’m completely smitten with you.
My whole world revolves around you.
I, this wonderful delicate one, have given you my heart and body as an offering.
I’ve given in. You cling to my heart as though I’ve known you forever.
You have the appearance of a goddess. My mind is rushing; you are the most precious to me.
My evening will not be the same without you.
Please wrap your arms around me; it will make my night.
I never expected you to become this close to me.
It’s incredible. It feels like I’m going to die.
This heart of mine is gradually becoming yours.
Please, see me from the perspective I see you.
Yes, I am in love with you.
Yes, you’re my entire world.
Lost my body and soul to you, o gentle beloved.
You cling on to my heart like I’ve known you all along.
You have the appearance of a goddess. My mind is rushing, you are the most precious to me.
