Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I do not know
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki
Taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh

Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I do not know
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki
Taki taki
Taki, taki
She wants a kiss or a a little bite
Explosive booty like Nagasaki
Turn on the engines Kawasaki
The club is full
And the Anunnaki came
Do not download it
The booty sticks out of her suit
She has no panties,  less work for the baby
It’s just that I know what she thinks she knows
She says he doesn’t want to but she spy me, huh-huh
The booty sticks out of her suit
She has no panties,  less work for the baby
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I do not know
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh

He said he wants to touch it, and tease it, and squeeze it
Well my piggy bank is hungry, my nigga, you need to feed it
If the text ain’t freaky, I don’t wanna read it
And just to let you know, this punani is undefeated
Aye
He said he really wanna see me more
I said we should have a date, where? At the Lamborghini store
“I’m kinda scary, hard to read, I’m like a Ouija board”
“But I’m a boss bitch, who you gonna leave me for?”
You hoes got no class, you bitches is broke still
I be talking cash, shit, while I’m popping my gold grill
I’m a whole rich bitch, and I work like I’m broke still
But the love be so fake, but the hate be so real
The booty sticks out of my suit
I did not wear pantyhose for the baby to work
Is that I know what you think you do not know
He says he does not want to, but he wants to eat the luggage
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I do not know
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki, taki taki
¡Rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh

Careful when you come through my way
My body-ody know how to play
Work it, keep it tight everyday
And I, I, I know you need a taste
When I ooo, you’re fallin’ in love
Give a little ooo-ooo, get it well done
Dancing on my ooo, make your girl wanna run
We keep moving till the sun come up
Because I am the party
Blow out your candles
Then have a siesta
They can try, pero no one can stop me
What my taki taki wants, ya
My taki taki gets, uhn??
Dance as if it were the last time
And show me that little step that I do not know
A nice little kiss, baby
Taki taki
Taki taki, ¡rumba!
Wo-oh, oh-oh
