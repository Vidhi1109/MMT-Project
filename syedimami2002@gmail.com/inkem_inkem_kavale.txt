What more do I want in life?
I have everything I need in you
You're the one who makes my heart beat
And fills my life with joy and happiness
Oh beloved, what magic have you cast on me?
I'm lost in your love, and I can't break free
You're the one who makes my dreams come true
And makes my life worth living too
You're the light that brightens up my world
You're the breeze that cools me down in the heat
You're the one who completes me
And makes me feel alive and whole again
Oh beloved, what magic have you cast on me?
I'm lost in your love, and I can't break free
You're the one who makes my dreams come true
And makes my life worth living too
You're the flower that blooms in my heart
You're the rain that nourishes my soul
You're the one who fills my life with love
And makes me feel like I'm on top of the world
Oh beloved, what magic have you cast on me?
I'm lost in your love, and I can't break free
You're the one who makes my dreams come true
And makes my life worth living too
You're the one I want to spend my life with
You're the one I want to grow old with
You're the one who makes my heart skip a beat
And makes me fall in love with you all over again
Oh beloved, what magic have you cast on me?
I'm lost in your love, and I can't break free
You're the one who makes my dreams come true
And makes my life worth living too.
