O beloved.
the intoxication that I have,
it's certainly your effect,
it's the fault of your sight.
come close, why are you far?
this madness of your love,
is my heart inebriated by you.
now, I have no consciousness,
no idea of what's around me,
what is this strange effect
after meeting you, O beloved.
don't walk like that, killing people.
find some solution to this riddle.
this big box of beauty, like some blossoming lotus,
I'll wait for it beacuse the fruit is sweet.
you are my dream,
you are the peace of my heart.
look at me, O beloved,
look at me just once.
kiss my body,
come close to me, O my companion.
I have lost my peace,
something has happened to me for sure,
after meeting you, O beloved.
