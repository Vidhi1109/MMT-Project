I’m in search of my life. Singing because I’m pissed off.
Humming a sad tune when I’m drunk. I’m mixing soda with my words.
This dude’s a loafer. A huge crackpot.
Getting hit over and over again. I’m now a strong man.
I’ve broke now. But I’ll survive.
I’ll fight it, I’m a fighter!
Here I come, blow the conch! The freeloading king is here.
Tamil is my mother tongue. I’m single and I’m young.
Blow the conch. I’m the king.
I’m single and I’m young.
Blow the conch. I’m the king. Mother tongue
I’m single and I’m young.
Even beasts have got Blue Cross.
Who do I have, to care for me?
I, too, want to run behind trees.
And sing duets. I want it!
I have no shame or dignity left.
This plastic flower has faded now.
I don’t say it out loud, but I’m crying inside.
The pure heart I have. Is worthless in this world.
Get away. I’m a useless fellow.
Tamil is my mother. I’m single and I’m young.
Blow the conch. I’m a useless king.
Tamil is my mother tongue.
I’m single and I’m young. I’m single and I’m young.
Blow the conch. I’m the king.
I’m single and I’m young.
Blow the conch. I’m the king. Mother-tongue.
I’m single and I’m young. Get away.
