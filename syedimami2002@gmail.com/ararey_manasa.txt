Oh heart, why are you restless?
What is it that you are searching for?
Life is like a flowing river
Why are you stuck in one place?
Oh heart, let's dance and celebrate
Let's live every moment to the fullest
Life is short, let's make it beautiful
Let's forget our worries and be happy
Oh heart, don't be afraid of the unknown
Let's face every challenge with courage
Life is like a beautiful dream
Let's make it a reality
Oh heart, let's dance and celebrate
Let's live every moment to the fullest
Life is short, let's make it beautiful
Let's forget our worries and be happy
Oh heart, don't be a prisoner of your fears
Let's break free and soar high
Life is like a blank canvas
Let's paint it with the colors of joy
Oh heart, let's dance and celebrate
Let's live every moment to the fullest
Life is short, let's make it beautiful
Let's forget our worries and be happy
Oh heart, let's spread love and happiness
Let's make the world a better place
Life is like a precious gift
Let's cherish it and make it count
Oh heart, let's dance and celebrate
Let's live every moment to the fullest
Life is short, let's make it beautiful
Let's forget our worries and be happy.
