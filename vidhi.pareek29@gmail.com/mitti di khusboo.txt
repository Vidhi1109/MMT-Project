When the water fell from the sky,
there was smell of (my own) soil (that I felt)..

Water rained from the sky,
Come, turn, O beloved,
come o God's good samaritan,
come turn to the path
where God's grace lives..
Where we were together, (it can well be for the motherland, object not specified)
I didn't value it
and left my own gardens..
In a foreign land, in rented houses,
I live now..
I keep searching day and night, all alone,
keep searching for your company..
O lord, get me to meet (her)
where lives God's grace..

When I saw my city being left
by the unknown one,
My voice also left..
How far do I sit, (how far I am)
becoming helpless,
O God, what are you punishing me for..
Listen to my voice once,
Fulfil my one wish,
listen to my one prayer..
Then I won't, I won't turn back and call you..
(to ask for anything again)
