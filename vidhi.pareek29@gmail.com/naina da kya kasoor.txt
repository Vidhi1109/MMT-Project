I have just seen a lovely face.
I don't know what's written on it.
A deep ocean, in which the heart has drowned,
I have become injured, am in that since then.

What's the fault of the eyes,
tell me O heart.

I had tied thousands of threads to this heart.
But this rascal turned out to be ahead of me.
What has happened to me!

It sprints this moment,
and runs that moment.
When what has to happen does happen,
the eyes are awake.
This seems to have happened.

the molds and slots of hearts match,
and the one who makes them (i.e. God), watches from the top.
there is neither a wick, nor lamp, nor camphor.
(basically nothing used for worshipping)
What's the fault of the eyes,
tell me O heart.
