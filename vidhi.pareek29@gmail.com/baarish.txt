I search for myself in your face
Now you're there in my eyes in such a way that
Even my dreams don't have any space there
This seasonal rain
The water of this rain
The drops of water
They search only for you
This desire to meet
This desire is old
My story is complete only because of you
When I enter your body
Then I pass through your breaths
That's when my heart finds peace
I'm homeless
I want to find a shelter within you
So give me that permission
There's no one in between us
We both are here
Then tell me, why are these distances there between us
This seasonal rain
The water of this rain
The drops of water
They search only for you
This desire to meet
This desire is old
My story is complete only because of you
I ask the winds for your address
Please come from somewhere
My heart is on a journey like the birds
Introduce me to life
I have just this one request
That you come for once
And learn what my heart hasn't said yet
This seasonal rain
The water of this rain
The drops of water
They search only for you
This desire to meet
This desire is old
My story is complete only because of you
