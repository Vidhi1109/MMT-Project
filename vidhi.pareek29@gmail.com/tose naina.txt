Should I stop this moment
Or should I throw myself into it
What should I do
I don't what to do in this moment
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
When my eyes connected with your eyes
When my eyes connected with your eyes
Then stories were made
When my eyes connected with your eyes
When my eyes connected with your eyes
Then stories were made
When my eyes connected with your eyes
I've lost my senses
Yes, I've lost my life
Yes beloved, I've placed you in my heartbeats
I've lost my senses
Yes, I've lost my life
Yes beloved, I've placed you in my heartbeats
When my eyes connected with your eyes
When my eyes connected with your eyes
Then stories were made
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
I've attained you after losing myself
That's how I've learnt to live
I've attained you after losing myself
That's how I've learnt to live
I've lost everything in your love
That's how I've learnt to live
My happiness is there in your smile
You're my happiness
When my eyes connected with your eyes
When my eyes connected with your eyes
Then stories were made
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
Our eyes have connected
