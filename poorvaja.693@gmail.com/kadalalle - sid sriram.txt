My dreams are flowing like a river, like waves trying to reach the shore.
My dreams are flowing like a river, like waves trying to reach the shore.
They become one as they reach the lap of the shore.
As the waves become one at the lap of the shore, so do I want to merge with you.
My longing for you overflows, my heart is swaying.
It desires the sweetness of your lips.
Without you around, I am being tortured by unknown passion like the heat of summer.
I want to be with you to quench my thirst.
I am extending my hand out to you to assist me..
Though seasons change, do you think my thought of you will change?
My desire asks for your companionship, like this.
My longing for you overflows, my heart is swaying.
It desires the sweetness of your lips.
My dreams are flowing like a river, like waves trying to reach the shore.
I have hidden you in my eyes, as my whole world.
I have sculpted myself like you.
The mischievous kiss on my cheek suddenly wraps me up in your youthfulness.
The many happy moments we shared, have filled and remained in the depths of my heart.
I merge with you, leaving myself behind.
My soul moves towards you, like this.
