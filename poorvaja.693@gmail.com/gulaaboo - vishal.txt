having applied the eye-kohl,
entangling the hair,
and rubbing the hand over the heart,
I am standing under your balcony,
like I am stuck in marsh..

I am standing under your balcony,
like I am stuck in marsh..
O pinky, pour some perfume over,
O Gulaabo, pour some perfume over (where I stand)..

O my god, you are like some sweet pickle,
O my god, you are a box of honey,
O my my,
wow, you are so lucky,
everyone’s out to seek you and you seek them out.

On the cocktail menu just your name is there, in the bar.
there are posters and ads out, 
this time, it’s your government..
let’s hold you close and kiss you in the car..
Gulaabo, just make a chaos..
