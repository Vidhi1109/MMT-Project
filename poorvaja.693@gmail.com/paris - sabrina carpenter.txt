If I asked that boy to jump, I know he would
He don't even have to say, "It's understood"
He treat me nice, he treat me right, he treat me good
Still I get so hesitant, still I get so hesitant
So I took myself where I think I should be
Something told me that it's waiting here for me
Parisian nights, Parisian high, Parisian breeze
Feeding me like medicine, feeding me like medicine, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Yeah, I already have love in LA
If you show me too much love, it makes me leave (makes me leave)
Guess that's one of many things that's wrong with me (that's wrong with me)
Looking past you when you're right in front of me
I won't do that anymore, I won't do that anymore (anymore)
Why'd it take so long for me to know this (know this)
Scared to put the water with the roses (roses)
Halfway 'cross the world for me to notice
But I notice, yeah, I notice, yeah
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Je ne voulais pas trouver l'amour
Mais Paris a quelque chose
Qui donne envie d'aimer, d'aimer passionnément
Mon cœur est à toi pour toujours
You will always have my heart
It's so romantic in Paris
Won't even try to compare it
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
Already have love
It's so romantic in Paris (so romantic in Paris)
Won't even try to compare it (I know that I try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it
But I already have love in LA
It's so romantic in Paris, babe
Won't even try to compare it (won't even try, won't even try, won't even try)
Thought I was sure that I'd find it (I was sure, I was sure)
But I already have love in LA
But I already have love in LA
