ls your beauty from within eyes, limbs or glow of your skin?
Or in the finger beautifully lingering all over me!
Beauty, so divine the way your hands clasp mine?

Love of my life, You are beyond everything in my life, my beloved!
My beauty, you give a complex to the word beauty in all respects!

You and your roving eyes speak volumes and appraise.
You have magic on me, crossing every boundary.

Into you l perceive.
l wear my heart on my sleeve.
To get into the groove.
I’m making my move.

Let our lips get pampered primal and unhampered.
Close your eyes, come close.
This is the ultimate lethal dose.

Within you shall l explore?
Can l share you hardcore?
To merge into my heart shall l show you the art?

Your beauty lS from within…
eyes, limbs and glow of your skin!

Love of my life.
You are beyond everything in my life, my beloved!
