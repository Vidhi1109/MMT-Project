You are the one inside me

Did you leave me?

Will you fill me up

With your love?

Oh, I fall in love

In your magic

Oh, I fall in love

Do you know?

In the middle of two stones

Do you want to come to me?

Like this flame in my heart

Do you want to light up?

You are special to me

My only secret

I fell in love with you

When I saw you

Oh, I am feeling high

In your love

Oh, I am flying now

With you

In the middle of two stones

Do you want to come to me?

Like this flame in my heart

Do you want to light up?

You are the one inside me

My only secret

I fell in love with you

When I saw you

You are the one inside me

Did you leave me?

Will you fill me up

With your love?

Thinking a lot

I don't understand anything

When you become me

I am not mine anymore

The little, trembling youth

Is filled with shyness

Oh, I wanna say

In my songs

Oh, I wanna say

With you

In the middle of two stones

Do you want to come to me?

Like this flame in my heart

Do you want to light up?

You are special to me

My only secret

I fell in love with you

When I saw you

You are the one inside me

Did you leave me?

Will you fill me up

With your love?
