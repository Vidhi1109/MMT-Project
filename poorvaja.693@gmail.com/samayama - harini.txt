Samayama!

Are we continuing without pause?

Samayama

Are we heading towards losing ourselves?

In the hands that hold, in the hearts that feel,

In the eyes that see, in the breath that breathes,

In the colorful notes of joy.

Samayama, Samayama, Samayama,

Isn't time just a moment in love?

Can you hear the sweetness in the air

That's flowing around us?

When I look into your eyes,

I see a sense of purpose.

And in this moment, I'm filled with happiness.

As the universe expands,

As the world turns,

The sounds of music fill the air.

Across time and space,

Through countless ages,

We're carried along by waves of joy.

As we go round and round,

Through ups and downs,

This dream becomes our reality.

Samayama, Samayama, Samayama,

Isn't time just a moment in love?

Can you hear the sweetness in the air

That's flowing around us?
