I'm not sure what has happened to my heart
When I met you, it felt that we were connected
How should I express this to you
Is this passion or pride
You've met me in such a way that
It's like the start of a new day
I have no clue where I'm going
I do whatever my heart wishes for
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
My heart is grateful to you
What kind of disease is this, and what name should I give it
No one else understands me
Only you know my language
I haven't seen craziness like mine in anyone, except you
My day starts with you and my evening sets with you
Now I can't take my eyes of you
All the free time that we have
We'll spend that together
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
My heart is grateful to you
What kind of disease is this, and what name should I give it
The walls of fear have broken and I can now see the world of my heart
Today my eyes have seen the sky of my dreams
I'm thankful to you
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
No matter what path I travel on
My love for you will always be there
From now on you're my companion
And even I'm your companion
And even I'm your companion
No matter what path I travel on
My heart is grateful to you
What kind of disease is this, and what name should I give it
