Why am I having so much fun
Have you mixed bhaang in the air
Why am I having so much fun
Have you mixed bhaang in the air
Why am I feeling highly intoxicated
Did you feed me sweets from your eyes
Your velvet shirt
Has turned pink
How did the crazy walk
Turned into a royal one, so?
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
Your wrists
Have come in my hands
When I twisted them
They felt like cream
It will prove expensive
This addiction of cream
For you to fast
Will be better for you
Your decorative forehead dot
Has turned into the moon
The desires of the heart
Have lost the count, so?
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
Why does it say no vacancy
As a curse on your lips
When your heart
Has the room empty
Has the room empty ...
Listen I know
What you want
Your words are like chants for god
Your intentions are like songs
This spontaneousness has become a problem
For every lock
Today you have become the key, so?
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
The beloved water gun
When you splashed on me
Then this simple and straightforward girl
Became an alcoholic
After wearing jeans
When you shook your waist
Then the neighbours sister-in-law
Went crazy
Yes this world is saying
There's a problem
Yes this world is saying
There's a problem
