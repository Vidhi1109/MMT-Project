I don't know why, loneliness has come
to meet me again..
At what turn has love brought me
 
Is my fight against myself,
or against God Himself,
At what turn has love brought me
 
Love is a game of cards,
of breaking and building trust
 
I don't know why, loneliness has come
to meet me again..
At what turn has love brought me
 
Don't know why I think,
that I am an empty road..
Have you lost me somewhere,
or have I gone lost myself?
Come find me again.
What should I promise you again
 
I'm a broken musical instrument,
I'm angry with myself,
I'm that voice which is hidden
somewhere in the chest..
Listen to me without saying anything..
How long can the heart bear silence
Love is a game of cards,
of breaking and building trust.
