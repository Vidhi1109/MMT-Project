I think about you even when I'm not thinking
There's a question as to why do we need to separate
The joy of being close to you was tremendous
I also attained a good share of separation from you
Since I'm far away from you
Why should I remain like this
I'm your pride
Come and erase this distance
You're like a dream that I've attained
So why should I break this dream
I think about you even when I'm not thinking
There's a question as to why do we need to separate
I'm a little upset with myself
I feel a little remorseful about you for no reason
I have this yearning and this confusion
That how should I live without you
Now I fight with everyone
Why do they try to be my god
All these hordes of people
They're like a wildfire
Why should I burn in this fire
They've failed in love
They're happy in this loss
Why should I become like them
My nights will tell you that your thoughts are there in my sleep
How should I forget you, since you're there in my thoughts
I think about you even when I'm not thinking
There's a question as to why do we need to separate
In front of my eyes every single moment is falling apart like sand
Your pain is entering my body like poison
O world come and test me, I won't be upset with you
My hope won't break even with these distances
Both of us aren't unfaithful
She's like a habit of mine that I'm unable to let go
