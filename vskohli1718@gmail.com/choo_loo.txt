still standing there

the heart is restless again

still standing there

that's waiting for you

touch me what ever you

don't get lost day and night

you are in my eyes

say that once you

only you are mine

you are in my eyes



still standing there

I only hope for you

how is this helplessness

what kind of thirst is this

touch me what ever you

don't get lost day and night

you are in my eyes

say that once you

only you are mine

you are in my eyes

will remain as it is

just like that, just like that

will remain as it is

just like that, just like that

will remain as it is

just like that, just like that

will remain as it is

just like that, just like that

touch me what ever you

don't get lost day and night

you are in my eyes

say that once you

only you are mine

you are in my eyes



yes i wait

you are gone

yes i wait

you are gone
