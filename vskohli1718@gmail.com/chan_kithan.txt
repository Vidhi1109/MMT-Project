Without you, the light seems even darker than kohl to me,
The cold winds took away my sleeps
My eyes don’t sleep now.

With stars, I kept awake missing you.

 


Oh my moon, how did you spend your night ?
Tell me the truth, what’s going on ?


 
Feel me from your heart,
And the tears from my eyes.

 


 


 

What could I possibly wish from shooting stars?
While I you only are supposed to make me comfortable/normal.

 


 

Without you, I won’t be able breathe,
My life resides in you.

 


Oh my love,  don’t become a stone heart person,
Sometime try to feel my emotions.

 


 



 

Having your thoughts in my heart,
I await you on the paths you may pass by
You have forgotten your promises,
Since you told you’d come back shortly.

 


 

Dear, I am afraid to loose you,
And live with your illusions only.

 


Ho moon of my life, how did it go over the night ?
