Your eyes are beautiful
They don't even look at me
Your eyes are beautiful
They don't even look at me
Come close to me and show me that smile
Don't be upset like this
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
Your sunglasses and your earrings are black
Now you're coming up with new demands
In a couple of months you've collected 40 pairs of heels
Wow, you deserve an applause
You empty my pockets
God damn your list is ever growing
Have some mercy on me and think about me
Don't keep fighting for such small things
Just listen to what I'm saying
I've made up my mind
Just listen to what I'm saying
I've made up my mind
Don't make excuses anymore
Don't make excuses anymore
Don't make excuses anymore
Or else it'll make me angry
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
O beautiful, if you love me then why do you show me your tantrums
You won't find anyone else who'll bear them with a smile
Your demands in love are incredible
Hey baby, I'll fulfill all of them
You know what I feel about you, right
I'll need heels from Paris
And a handbag from Los Angeles
I'll need heels from Paris
And a handbag from Los Angeles
To go on a world tour with you
Or else it'll make me angry
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
Promise me today
That you'll buy me a Prada gift
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
Or else keep staring at me from a distance
And I'll find someone else who will
