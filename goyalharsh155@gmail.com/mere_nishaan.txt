I don't exist in humans
I'm sold in the shops
I don't exist in humans
I'm sold in the shops
I made this world from my hands
Not with soil, but with emotions
I'm roaming around searching
Where are my signs
Where are my signs
My signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
I walked with you being your shadow
When the sun came out, I provided shade for you
I walked with you being your shadow
When the sun came out, I provided shade for you
I stayed in your paths
Like a companion
But still you're stuck in traps
You look for questions in the answers
Where are you lost, where
Where are my signs
Where are my signs
My signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
I've created these birds and this flowing water
From the earth to the sky, it's all my story
I've created these birds and this flowing water
From the earth to the sky, it's all my story
You're also created by me
Why do you divide me here
Destinies are made by me
These images are filled with life
But why are they still speechless
Where are my signs
Where are my signs
My signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
O ho ho my signs, my signs
