On every page of my (book) of fate
In my life and after my death
In every tomorrow and in every second
Please write her (name) as mine
 
In every story and every tale
In true stories of love in the world of heart
In every part of my life
Please write her (name) as mine
 
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
 
I'm hers, I'm in her (heart), I'm from her (my existence is due to her)
Please let me be hers
I'm thirsty, she's river, she's the source of my life
Give me a home, a street and a city
in her name
I'll walk and stop for her
Give me a loving heart but only with her love in it
My house will echo only with her laughter
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
 
You may half my laughter and happiness
You may take my life but ...
Promise me that
Her tears, her sorrows, her pain, her wounds
will be mine everywhere, every-time for whole life
I'd happen that she'd live inside of me
She'd never leave and be part
 
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
Oh God, oh God whenever you make (pairs) make her mine
 
On every page of my (book) of fate
In my life and after my death
In every tomorrow and in every second
Please write her (name) as mine
