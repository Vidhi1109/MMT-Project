Why did you lavish me with your love if it was phoney?
If your feelings for me were phoney, why did you lavish them on me?
Why did you come if you were going to leave in such a manner? Why did you come if you were going to leave this way?
Please come near me and oppress me,
come and end this relationship for no reason.
Oh, ruthless one! Oh, my cruel lover!
Oh, ruthless one! Oh, my cruel lover!
Oh, ruthless one! Oh, my cruel lover!
Oh, ruthless one! Oh, my cruel lover!
What’s the point of congregating if there’s no shared sense of emotional distress? What’s the significance of coming together and reveling if there’s no collective experience of heartfelt anguish?
What kind of heart is it, if it has never broken? What kind of heart is it, if it has never been broken?
Come and make my situation worse.
Come aggravate my injuries.
Why, Lord, is my sweetheart so insane?
He took my lights and replaced them with shades.
Why have I been ruined for being faithful in love?
Dear Lord, why does the person whose heart you fill with all the love of the world have a stone heart?
Why isn’t there any love between us anymore?
Why didn’t you say what was on your mind if it was in your heart?
If you had something to say, why didn’t you say it?
If you were ever in love with me, come and honour me.
You could also say that you never loved me.
Without you, my heart would be like an empty shell.
I’d try to live without you, but what is life without you?
