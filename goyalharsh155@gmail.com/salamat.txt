It doesn't matter if I stay in this world
It doesn't matter if you leave
Just let this love of ours live long1
 
Doesn't matter if the earth and the sky
Remain fine or not
Just let this love of ours live long
 
Oh o.. mm..
 
I'm afraid of losing you
If I find God, I'll ask him
"What do I do with this life
Tell me"
 
Oh..
Now that you are with me
I'm not thirsty anymore
My prayers have been heard
 
Doesn't matter if I-
-Stay alive or not
Let this love of ours live long
 
Oh o.. mm..
