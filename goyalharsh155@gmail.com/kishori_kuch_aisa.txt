Just once I get the dust of your feet
Life may go but your name may not go out of mouth
  Kishori, such arrangements should be made.
Let the name of Radha Radha Radha be on your lips.

Beautiful Bhajan of Radha Rani: Jhula Jhula Ri Radhe Rani

Returning to the rule of Braj, drinking water from the Yamuna.
Shree Radha Radha chanting, or the life came out of the body.
May Shri Radhe bless us so much.
If I take someone's name, your name should come on my tongue.

I have taken your name while falling down.
You didn't let me fall, you held me.

The most beautiful bhajan of Sadhvi Purnima ji: Color me in your own color

  Kishori, such arrangements should be made.
Let the name of Radha Radha Radha be on your lips.
Radhe Radhe Radhe Radhe Bol Manwa Radhe Radhe Radhe Radhe Bol
  to the door of true devotion
open your heart
  radhe radhe radhe radhe bol manwa
  Radhe Radhe Radhe Radhe Lyrics
