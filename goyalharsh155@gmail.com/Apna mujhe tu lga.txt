You are an unknown
You are a stranger
Yet why are you recognizable 


When you are



In deep sleep


Why are you awake in me





When I find you



The heart smiles



What is my relation with you



Why should I search in you



What should I want from you



What else of mine is inside you



I don’t know



What part of mine is in you



But, Oh Stranger



You seem like my own



I don’t know


What is my relationship with you


But, Oh Stranger



You seem like my own




Happiness in Life


Is because of you



Or else, sadness in life


Are by many reasons





That’s beside the point

That we met today



But my heart knows you for centuries



I don’t know


What is my relationship with you


But, Oh Stranger



You seem like my own



Heaven came into my arms


Happiness


Because you showed kindness



Both bodies have been introduced in such a way


That we became lovers to the soul



We have just walked


A couple of steps together


And I have found


The address of Life



I don’t know


What is my relationship with you


But, Oh Stranger



You seem like my own



You are an unknown



You are a stranger



Yet why are you recognizable 



When you are


In deep sleep


Why are you awake in me




When I find you



The heart smiles



What is my relation with you


Why should I search in you



What should I want from you



What else of mine is inside you



I don’t know


What part of mine is in you


But, Oh Stranger


You seem like my own


I don’t know


What is my relationship with you


But, Oh Stranger

You seem like my own
