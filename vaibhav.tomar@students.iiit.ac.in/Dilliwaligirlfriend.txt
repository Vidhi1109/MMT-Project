Yeah!
What a look
What a grace
I'm only chasing you
What a dance
What eyes
My heart has become your fan
What a smile
What a style
You stole the file of my sleep
Sometimes soft
Sometimes rude
Your attitude is killer
For you I broke the signals
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
Hey for you I broke the signals
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
The signs of your eyes look fraud to me
By God you look like a desperate lover
Taking the promises and vows
Saving my pocket money
I've come for you after saving money
I've even said goodbye to my family
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
For you I broke the signals
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
I've started to come in your lane
I've given my heart to you
I've started to look at you
Now I've become a proper lover
Today now I've boycotted you
I've been noting all your acts
I'll take you to the police station and file a report
Don't fight like this
I'll make your mood light
I'll show you a scene from film Golmaal
I've written your name on the wedding card
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
For you I broke the signals
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
You've become mannerless in love
Without any reason you are frozen on me
I've refused you a 100 times
But still you want to be my friend
My fashion has increased for you
You seem like day and night to me
My future looks bright with you
A better guy than you
Some handsome boy
Will take me weighing against gold ... oye
Today for you I turned the car here and there
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
You're a liar
You broke signals for me
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
I've even said goodbye to my family
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
For you I broke the signals
I've come leaving my girlfriend from Delhi
Yeah!
What a look
What a grace
I'm only chasing you
What a dance
What eyes
My heart has become your fan
What a smile
What a style
You stole the file of my sleep
Sometimes soft
Sometimes rude
Your attitude is killer
