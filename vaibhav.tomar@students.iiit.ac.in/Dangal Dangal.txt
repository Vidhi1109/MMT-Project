From the womb uptil grave2
Is your story(life)
Dangal Dangal1
Dangal Dangal
Your sun would rise and set2
And the stars constantly play
Dangal Dangal
 
When your heart
Is full of fear3
Rekindle your courage
You need to be brave
 
Like a wild elephant
Is every challenge
That faces you
Stares in your eyes
And makes you nervous4
So, Gazing back at it
And challenging it is called
Dangal Dangal
 
Trust your dreams
As hard as Steel
People will keep gossiping,
How many of them would you bother?
 
Today people talk about you
Let them talk to their content
There will be your day
That day you need to show them5
 
For numerous bleats of the sheep
One vehement roar of the Lion is called
Dangal Dangal
 
When fate gives you
A chance to prove yourself
Calculated days it leases
To brace yourself6
 
It takes, as security,
Every drop you sweat
And in return
It fills you with zeal7
 
To the hard work of a person
The humble praise of fate is called
Dangal Dangal
