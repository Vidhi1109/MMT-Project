The red and blue lines inside you 


It is the heart that connects them
With a voice that won't lose even in the wind 

Now I'm growing the words to deliver 


Time is a sleeper, the wind blows, the stars are gloomy, people are haze
When you ask me why I'm crying 

I can't seem to catch up with the meaning of the fact that we met 

This body alone is not enough scream
My heart trembled only when I touched your hand 

How many meanings must we cross before we can reach it? 

Stupidity is fine, ugliness is fine 

Beyond the truth, I want to take your hand
precious memories that I can't remember 

Thoughts here that cannot be put into words
maybe maybe 


That's all this heart is made of

maybe maybe 


"Noticing" you, even now, that chest 

strike
When you ask me why I'm crying 


I can't seem to catch up with the meaning of the fact that we met 


This body alone is not enough scream

My heart trembled only when I touched your hand 


How many meanings must we cross before we can reach it? 


Stupidity is fine, ugliness is fine 


Beyond the truth, I want to live with you
