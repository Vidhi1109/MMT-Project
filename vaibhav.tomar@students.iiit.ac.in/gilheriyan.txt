why are the days
changing colors and twittering along,
I don't know, I don't know..

why are the squirrels of the heart
jumping as they move?
I don't know, I don't know.

why is the weather a little crazy,
or is it my mood that is a bit mischievous,
why is the taste of these mischiefs so juicy?
I don't know, I don't know

why are the branches of wishes 
filled with thousands of flame trees,
I don't know, I don't know

I've struck a new friendship with the sky,
the earth is envious of me,
it makes faces at me,
and tells me that I am getting spoiled

even life these days
is bored of counting,
and reading a couplet or two 
along with the numbers of mathematics.

I have left the decisions of right and wrong,
I don't know, I don't know
