the day I don't see you,
I go around like crazy people.
who'd ever love you,
like I do..

why to think where to go,
let's go where we are taken by 
these impatiences..
impatiences...


clouds will bow down to your feet, 
as long as you remember
that your estate, your treasure
is your thirst,
(and your wish to succeed.)

why stop this cavalcade now,
let's go there where these impatiences
take us..

what are these lights and these darknesses,
ahead of both are your (own) sceneries..
why do you look outside for light,
your torches are inside you..


why look for (someone's) footsteps?
let's go, where these impatiences take it..
these impatiences...
