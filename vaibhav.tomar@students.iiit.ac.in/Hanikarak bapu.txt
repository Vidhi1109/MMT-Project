mercy on others, and torturing (your own) kids,
O my dad, don't do this torture.

O Dad, you are injurious to health.

have some mercy on us, 
we are little kids.

so much, so much discipline,
it's enough to force us to commit suicide.

you said going for picnics etc. isn't allowed,
that's a big torture.

you tell kids not to be childish,
that's a big torture.

toffees, chooran, toys and games,
kulchas, naan and parathas,
have been stopped since you scolded us, O father.
in the age when having fun and roaming around look good,
why are the hands of clock controlling that age?
the condition of the vehicle of fate is bad.

O my father,
father came..
yeah, our father is the driver of this vehicle.
O father, for the health you are injurious.

you told that eating hot and sour things isn't allowed.
that's a big torture.

you ask earthen dolls for body building,
that's a big torture.

our childhood is gone for a toss, this garden is gone,
don't know preparation for what kind of fight is going on,
sleeping or awake, our tears are coming up all the time.
still Mogambo isn't happy, (even though) we have dedicated our lives to him.
are we so useless according to you?

better than you.. (leave me alone father!)
better than you are villains of our Hindi movies.
O father you are injurious to health.
