this fake world is temporary,
my pain is true.
O beloved, this relationship of ours
is a delusion like a mirage.

eyes, which used to dream together,
they have cried such on separation today.
eyes, which used to stay the nights awake together,
they shut such in the morning now...

steps have gone apart,
which had taken this oath,
that they'd always be together,
and now this pain is borne together
by the wet eyes

the breathe is shocked, the heart is troubled,
wondering why my life is about to cry..
why is the hope lost to disappointment,
why is there a storm of questions in the heart...

eyes, were the stars of the sky,
which break such in the eclipse..
eyes, which used to enjoy the sun,
now stop and look for some shade..
