I know it, back when no one
Would think of me to take home
Had nowhere else to belong
Caught in a knot and woke alone
You took a step while reaching out
You shook my life and pulled me out
Then filled the room with your smile
I won't forget the look

Through life, in every corner
Your moon light prayers calling
Into this more, keep walking next to me
And soon, taking on history
Though life can be sore
While light is seen a lot more
We share every bit of what those times are made of


Looking again, ever the stories kept inside
All memories come out
Overwhelmed, I share them with you
Away, alone, no one will see the step you take
And all that you've been through
For me to get to be here, right there and so close
All that it would take
For me to be whole and delighted, staying here with you
Coming again with the words
I wanna say is just
"I am grateful"


Oh, so soon it was
A joyous spring has come to us
A new departure season, true
A far away new city, move
You let me be with you once again
When falling alone and feeling deep
I'll be here so that you can see
I send it all and root
Because I'm always here for you


Now we see, everything life brings you is not an easy journey
As you went, hard to be concealing all your tears
Still, on, we go
Every day, take a step at your pace
So, you can become mature and walk on through
For me to get to be sitting here next to you, ah
To me, if I can know you smile
If you show me your brighter days
I'll pray for every joy you got, deep inside your heart
Is found within, to be a part of what you'll be


Say, giving you so much is your own
I can understand plenty love around you has bloomed
Don't cry, not any more
Remember now, back in the day
How you would keep your face in smiles, always


Looking back, I stare at these views I follow
All memories come from within, I shared them with you
Away, alone, no one will see the step you take
Nor all the drops of tears you saw pour out
Becomes a new meaning, to align with you
I could soon know that plenty true love got to bloom
Coming again with the words
I wanna say is just
"I am grateful"


It's true, evermore
You will be okay
It's true, evermore
My love remains for you
