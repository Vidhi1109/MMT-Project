I will fly across the clouds.
And I will sing to my tune.


All my crazy, crazy dreams.
I make into my one desire.


I know that I don’t belong here.
I need to make my own life.


I’ve got one life with hundreds of dreams.
Yes, I’ve got one life and hundreds of dreams.
And each one will come true.


I got one life and hundreds of dreams.
And I want to live each day pleasantly.



There are so many obstacles in my path, and so many battles to fight.
But my heart beats with hope. Isn’t that right?


Life is a bit hard. Who knows what the future holds for me.
But I’m no less than a star. Is that not right?


I know I don’t belong here.
I need to make my own life.


I’ve got one life and hundreds of dreams.
And I want to make each one come true.
I’ve got one life and hundreds of dreams.
I want to live pleasantly every day.
