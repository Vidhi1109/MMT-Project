Knowing we’re going to meet, 
Knowing we’re going to make love,
It doesn’t allow me to live peacefully.
It doesn’t allow me to live peaceably.
The clouds overhead are creating a romantic atmosphere, 
but I can’t seem to find you anywhere, oh dear.
I can’t sit comfortably 
because there are instruments playing in my heart.
My eyes are overjoyed with excitement.
I am filled with love and am looking for you.
It makes it difficult for me to concentrate.
It prevents me from focusing.
Knowing we’re going to meet, 
Knowing we’re going to make love,
It doesn’t allow me to live peacefully.
It doesn’t allow me to live peaceably.
I am thrilled whenever I hear your name.
I become sentimental and think about you.
If it were possible to tattoo the heart, 
I would tattoo your name on it.
May you never experience difficulty.
I have summoned all concerns to myself.
I am no longer allowed to consume alcohol.
I am no longer supported to drink liquor.
Knowing we’re going to meet, 
Thoughts that we’re going to make love,
It doesn’t allow me to live peacefully.
It doesn’t allow me to live peaceably.
