I have regularly spent the nights sleeplessly. You could ask the skies; even the stars witness it.
Consistently, I have spent money on you,
Whenever I said something to you, you didn’t give enough importance.
After hurting me, you slept carefree as nothing happened.
My love is upset with me, and I am not sure how to convince it, Dear.
You didn’t lose anything, while nothing of mine remained safe.
What I am telling is the truth.
You didn’t lose anything, I have lost everything. It’s the truth.
I always knew you wouldn’t be able to fulfill (or carry) our relationship for long,
But it was my mistake to believe you still.
Our relationship didn’t matter to you at all,
I was fool enough not to find it out sooner.
I still pray for your well-being; I am telling the truth.
If you are happy without me, I also will move on someday.
You didn’t lose anything, I have lost everything. It’s the truth.
Why is it so difficult to admit if another person is right;
and to accept who of us was wrong and who was right?
Now you consider your career (or life choices) vital than me,
it’s hard for my heart to believe. I am telling you the truth.
If you are happy without me, I also will move on someday.
You didn’t lose anything, while nothing of mine remained the same.
What I am telling is the truth.
