O bird,
little bird,
come back again to the yard..
The dark is deep and covered in blood..
pick the straws of sunrays from the sky,
and come back again to the yard..
We have done injustice against you a thousand times,
We have given you tortures of the world..
we didn't think-
if you fly away,
this earth will remain deserted without you..
with whose presence shall my yard be adorned..
I'll embed all the stars in your wings,
I'll weave for you a rainbow colored scarf,
I'll fill the dark night in your kohl,
I'll rub raw fragrance in your henna (adorned hands),
I'll give a new dream to your eyes..
