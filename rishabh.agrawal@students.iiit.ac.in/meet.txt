It’s like my clean sheet alike heart has got a poetic song
The first rain on this land, Only love has brought.
The faith I looked for in every eye
I have got it in you
You’ve become my life,
I have learned this.
Dear you’re my friend
Dear you’re my love
The one which cannot be forgotten from the lips
You’re that anthem of me dear. 
When I open my eyes in the morning
All I see is your face
From now on, In the soft sunshine of you
I want build by world
And when you laugh on the small incidents
My whole life laughs along with you.
You only are my friend
You only are my friendship
That cannot be separated from the lips
Alike song you’re for me.
