It was fun even when the smile came,
Give even sorrow so much happiness,
He started smiling.
I am very sad, my smile is gone,
Just move your lips, I want to see you.
You look at the one who shows you life,
Give even sorrow so much happiness,
He started smiling.
It was fun even when the smile came,
Give even sorrow so much happiness,
He started smiling.
Who won't smile for long
Will forget the beauty and beats.
My heart started laughing unnecessarily,
Give even sorrow so much happiness,
He started smiling.
