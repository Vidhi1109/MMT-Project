You will never say it
So, why don’t I just say it?
Tell me where are you
I will come there
Where the rainy weather blossomed
Where our paths crossed
Where I spend all day in your arms
I came here but you didn't come
Sometimes I start thinking about you while sitting
My eyes can’t see you anywhere
So, whom should I call now?
I am here but you didn’t come
I thought that if I meet you
I would tell everything that’s in my heart
Maybe you went too far away
I am left alone, don’t know where have you lost
While going away, look back again
Heart says find me once again
She will come back here someday
I am here but you didn’t come
But you didn’t come
But you didn’t come
BUt you didn’t come
