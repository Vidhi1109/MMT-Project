oh let some noise draw me to you
I don't know which way to go

in your gestures
whispered something
i am confused
how to say goodbye

oh let some noise draw me to you
I don't know which way to go

Why are the wishes from the universe
What kind of conspiracies is God doing
You would have been my way
Your story would not have remained incomplete

oh let some noise draw me to you
I don't know which way to go
which way, which way, which way
which way, which way, which way

Towards you..
