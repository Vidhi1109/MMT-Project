Dance O holy man,
spread the color
Dance O holy man,
spread the color
 
Twisting and turning
Forget the world and dance
Start humming a tune
Sing and then dance
Get lost in these vibrant scenes
Drink and making people drink then dance
With the intoxicating eyes
Gaze at someone and then dance
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
 
Listen Lady,
You're an intoxication
All my senses have gotten lost
 
Lose Your senses, O crazy guy
Lose Your senses and dance
Come near me, O crazy guy
Come near me and dance
All the desires that are there in the heart
Awaken them all and dance
In Your body and soul, burn a fire and dance
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
 
Even after seeing, it's not believable
Why are You such a beauty
With Your body, my life becomes beautiful
In front of Your beauty, no one else is more beautiful
 
Put my dreams in Your eyes and then dance
Keep me in Your heart
Then make Your heart-beat and then dance
If You truly love me,
then awaken Your love and dance
Your heart and soul
Loose it all on me and then dance
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
 
Oh My! Your charm
I like the way you move
Oh My! Your body
I like to see you groove
Oh My! Your gaze
It says I wanna dance with you
