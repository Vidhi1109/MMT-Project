There were some moments,
lazy, confused,
in the air..
Sometimes, a little fearing,
smiling, not knowing, where to go..
Listen to the sweet talks,
of the skies,
Listen to the sweet talks,
of unspoken moments..
(we) move while falling, stumbling and getting up
but this morale doesn't go down..
Let's fly the kites of
O life, we have the intoxication of togetherness,
this togetherness of friends..
O life, don't give us the medicine of soberness,
just pray for us, pray for us..
As we follow the dreams
there is patrol of memories on the way..
burning this black night,
We'll get a bright morning.
