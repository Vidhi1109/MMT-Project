Decorate your lips on my lips
Now tell me who are you
Decorate your lips on my lips
Now tell me who are you
Break yourself in my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
In my arms
Drown me in your emotions and in your drenched moments
Since I'm thirsty for love
Due to your grace and your beautiful mistakes
There's life in these moments
Forget about shyness
Be carefree just like me
Lose yourself in my nights
In my nights
In my nights
In my nights
Decorate your lips on my lips
Now tell me who are you
In your feelings and in your fragranced breaths
There's an aroma of sandalwood
In the shelter of your heart and in the spread sighs
I have a desire to go to sleep
Hide your face behind my face
Make me hear your heartbeats
Look at yourself in my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
In my eyes
