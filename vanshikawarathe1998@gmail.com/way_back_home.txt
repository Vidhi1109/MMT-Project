I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home
No matter how hard I close it, it's like a drawer that opens again
You flew high into the sky and you keep coming back to me
Even the breakup I swallowed with difficulty is still the same oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
I found you on the countless roads
My heart that tried to empty is filled with you again like this
At the end of my steps, you always bump into me
stop, stop
I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home
Open the room where you sleep quietly and take out your memories
Above the broken time, you clearly come to mind
I live with you trapped in a lost heart
stop, stop
I go to find you sleeping in the stopped time
No matter how much I block you, in the end I'm by your side
After a long, long journey, I'm back now
To the house called you, now, way back home
Turn the world upside down and try to find it
A story that only ended with you
Even if I lose everything, I only need you
Hug me here where all the lights are off
When I close my eyes, it comes silently
On top of this heart, you pile up another layer
I need you, no one else
Come back to me until that day I'm not done
