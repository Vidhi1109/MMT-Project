The heart and the mind
Who made them fight
From the back door
It came in a slinking manner
It's slightly devilish
It's slightly helpless
Love is like a ghost
But this ghost is very adorable
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Should I admire him or slap him
Offo o ... o o o!
Look he has come
With mischief in his pocket
Similar to yours
Are his habits as well
He is hot from outside
He is soft from inside
He is slightly noble
He is slightly shameless
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Should I admire him or slap him
Offo o ... o o o!
Even the surprises were surprised
Now with all my senses I'm acting naive
I'm sitting down losing my heart in love
My autocracy started to cost me a lot
He feels my shoulders calling me a pal
He opens his wings as he gets a chance
His signs are beyond my hands reach
Love is like a ghost
But this ghost is very adorable
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Offo ... should I scold and make him run
Offo ... or should I embrace him
Should I admire him or slap him
Offo o ... o o o!
