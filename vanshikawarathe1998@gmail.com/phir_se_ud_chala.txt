I flew once again
I flew and left the world below me
Now I surrender to you
Now people are far away
And the valleys are miles away
Now my cloud like body
Some smoke comes to touch me
But some kind of smoke
Makes my body wet, that never happens
I didn't stop at any point
I didn't even meet myself
I have this complaint, but I'm not upset
The cities and the villages are the same
The people and the names are the same
I flew once again
These dreams are like the sand
Even if you dust them from the eyes
It still comes back
So many dreams
How should I tell you
Why I broke them and left them
But still they come with me
They take me and fly, why is that
At times branches and at times leaves
Are roaming with me from door to door
Sometimes headdress, sometimes rain
I'll become Ravana, I'll live as dead
At times branches and at times leaves
Sometimes day is night, sometimes not
What is the truth, what is a myth
Oh God, oh God
Here and there, scattered everywhere
The wind might take me towards you
Your memories are pulling me
Towards you
In colourful mansions
I'll keep flying
In colourful mansions
I'll keep flying
