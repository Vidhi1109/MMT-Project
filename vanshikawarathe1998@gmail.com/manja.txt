You're like an abrasive string that cuts the kite of my heart
And after being cut, it lands on the roof of your house
You're like an abrasive string that cuts the kite of my heart
And after being cut, it lands on the roof of your house
I lose my breaths when you turn and look back at me
And after being cut, it lands on the roof of your house
You're like an abrasive string that cuts the kite of my heart
I was a naive butterfly
I used to fly here and there
I don't know how I came to a stop on the roof of your house
The sceneries are enjoyable, just like I wanted
What's there in between us
The sceneries are enjoyable, just like I wanted
What's there in between us
My heart is a bird made from paper and you're the entire sky
When it sees you then it flies away in a heartbeat
You're like an abrasive string that cuts the kite of my heart
And after being cut, it lands on the roof of your house
You're like an abrasive string that cuts the kite of my heart
And after being cut, it lands on the roof of your house
