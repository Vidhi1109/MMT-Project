a girl, whose name is love,
is missing, is missing, ah, missing.
simple, pretty beauty,
is missing, missing, is lost.
her face is like fairies,
and it seems she has got a soul as kind as Mariam’s.
when she smiles, flowers fall off,
and when she walks, she looks like a ghazal.
she’s tall like an oak tree,
and an age that is as much as that of embers, (that is she’s very young)
but she understands the talk of the eyes.
