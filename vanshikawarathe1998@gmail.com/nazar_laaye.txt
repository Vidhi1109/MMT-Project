I've lost myself, I'm completely yours
You're sweet and I'm salty
I'm completely yours, totally yours
I've lost myself, I'm completely yours
You're sweet and I'm salty
I'm completely yours, totally yours
The colour of vermilion is true
It's true that all that I've attained
Is because you've come in my heart
I've found my soulmate
May no one cast an evil spell on you
The heart is enjoying the good time
It's the time for sewing love together
May no one cast an evil spell on you
May those burn, who wish bad for you
Let this strange world know that
May no one cast an evil spell on you
I've lost myself, I'm completely yours
You're sweet and I'm salty
I'm completely yours, totally yours
I've lost myself, I'm completely yours
You're sweet and I'm salty
I'm completely yours, totally yours
A black dot of kohl behind one's ears
Protects them from the evil eye
The world cheats in million of ways
By way of its sweet talks
I'll circle the chillies around your body
I won't feel shy
I won't lose the world, my soulmate
My heart keeps on saying that
I've lost myself, I'm completely yours
You're sweet and I'm salty
I'm completely yours, totally yours
