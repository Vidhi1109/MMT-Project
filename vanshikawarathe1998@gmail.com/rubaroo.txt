Hey dude!
Just now I've realized that
Somewhere within me there is a fire
It's a new morning and I'm burning
I've overpowered the sun
I'm face to face with light
I'm face to face with light ... hey!
The dream that was lost
I found it and it's blossoming
It was iron but it has melted
It stretched, slipped
And turned into a sitar
I'm face to face with light
I'm face to face with light ... hey!
The fog cleared and my sky has opened
I have a new path and a new journey
If you can be my companion
Then look into my eyes
The fog cleared and my sky has opened
I have a new path and a new journey
If you can be my companion
Then look into my eyes
My flame is fighting with the storms
My flame is now marching like torches
Even if I disappear without a trace
Whether this caravan exists or not
I have drunk the brightness
I'm radiant and alive
So why keep suffering
I'm face to face with light
I'm face to face with light ... hey!
The fog cleared and my sky has opened
I have a new path and a new journey
If you can be my companion
Then look into my eyes
I'm face to face with light
I'm face to face with light ... hey!
Hey dude!
Hey dude!
Hey dude!
