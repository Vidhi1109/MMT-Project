Yes, I'm silent just like these roads
I'm hiding in your dreams and your desires
I don't know why this situation is there every day
You're the story of my soul
The dampness of your hair
The intoxication of the eyes
Even if I lose myself here
Then it's not my fault
Why did these stories get lost in the moments
I was wounded and I lost myself in these words
We were strangers, but now you're hidden in my heart
We're like the morning shadows
The night belongs to your breaths
The morning belongs to your lips
Even if I lose myself here
Then it's not my fault
Then it's not my fault
The dampness of your hair
The intoxication of the eyes
Even if I lose myself here
Then it's not my fault
The night belongs to your breaths
The morning belongs to your lips
Even if I lose myself here
Then it's not my fault
Then it's not my fault
Then it's not my fault
