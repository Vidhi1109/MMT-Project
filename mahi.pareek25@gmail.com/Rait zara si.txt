I’d like to be yours. I’d like to have you.

Living in love for a moment feels like living for centuries to me.

I’m thinking about living for centuries.

Your fragrance is on my hands, and it has delighted my heart.


It’s slipped through my hands like sand through my hands.


Every day, my heart reads about love. My heart is drawn to you.


It flies through the air like sand.


Your fragrance lingers everywhere.


This feeling! A sensation in my heart tells me that you are nearby.


During the difficult time, I lost faith in myself, but I kept having faith in you.


It is necessary to keep going and to keep changing. It is also necessary to be similar to you.

My heart is a little fluttering. It is satisfied with only talking.

Then it splatters out of eyes like sand from your hands.


Your fragrance is on my hands. If you ask me the truth


You’re like sand on my face.
