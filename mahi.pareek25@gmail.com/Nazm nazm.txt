You stay on my lips like a poem
I'll remain awake in your eyes like a dream
You come and reside in my soul like love
I run in the direction where your music plays
Beloved, let's hold our hands and make a promise
From now on you're my wish and my intention
Beloved, take my name as I'm your poem
The rains keep following you
You scatter in my breaths like fragrance
Like a beggar who desires you, I ask you from yourself
You come and reside in my soul like love
I run in the direction where your music plays
Beloved, there's a letter from you in the envelope of my heart
Beloved, how did this unworthy person attain such great destiny
Beloved, there's a letter from you in the envelope of my heart
Beloved, how did this unworthy person attain heaven
You stay on my lips like a poem
You stay on my lips like a poem
I'll remain awake in your eyes like a dream
You come and reside in my soul like love
I run in the direction where your music plays
