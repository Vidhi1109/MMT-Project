Two sparkling eyes, a face like the moon,
What can I say about her, she's amazing
Like a royal piece at a feast,
There's no one as graceful as her
Wearing a royal dress,
She arrived all dressed up
That's my sweet heart
Sitting shyly on the side,
As if she's the bride
That's my sweet heart
Wearing a royal dress...

How do I say thank you,
It's her kindness towards me
In the neighborhood of the uninvited,
She's come as a guest
How do I say thank you...
It feels like the wedding house,
Has become lucky since her arrival

She's become the life of the gathering,
What can I say about her, she's amazing
She's become the desire of a poor heart,
There's no one as graceful as her
Wearing a royal dress...

Wow, oh wow
What a thing to behold
Wow, oh wow
What a thing to behold
