Let’s go!

A cyclone has come wearing shorts and t-shirts, yes sir
A cyclone has come wearing shorts and t-shirts
Call everyone and spread the news
Beware of the wildcat
Doesn’t matter if You’re from Chandigarh or Delhi
She’ll defeat You easily
She’ll teach You a lesson
She’ll beat You by doing/performing a brilliant reversal manoeuvre
She’ll defeat You, she’ll defeat You

She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome

O girl! This girl
Now listen to this

The rope of Your ego will burn out
She has such a fire in her grip
She’ll measure it with a measuring tape
How high You hold Your nose
Your breath will come to a halt
She’ll throw You down really hard, I swear
She’ll defeat You easily
She’ll teach You a lesson
She’ll beat You by doing a brilliant reversal manouvre
She’ll defeat You, she’ll defeat You

She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
She’s so bold and strong/fearsome
