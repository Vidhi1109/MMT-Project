Abracadabra, my beloved is crazy
He roams from Delhi to Agra wearing a loincloth and a shirt

My heart feels tempted looking at her earrings from Bareilly
When she moves her waist then millions fall down
Music
My heart feels tempted looking at her earrings from Bareilly
When she moves her waist then millions fall down

Why are you taunting me
Why are you acting smart
I'm not your beloved
Neither are you my lover

Hey sweet one
Hey sweet one, your drama creates an uproar
When I look in your eyes then it's like a crime
I'm crazy for you whether you believe it or not
Listen up beloved, I've become your lover

Music

Don't create a commotion
The neighbourhood is watching
What will you achieve by creating a scene
Let me hold the end of your dress
Don't think I'm useless
After trying to sweet talk with me
Why are you taunting me
Why are you acting smart
I'm not your beloved
Neither are you my lover


Hey sweet one
Hey sweet one, your drama creates an uproar
When I look in your eyes then it's like a crime
I'm crazy for you whether you believe it or not
Listen up beloved, I've become your lover

Abracadabra, my beloved is crazy
He roams from Delhi to Agra wearing a loincloth and a shirt
